schematic representation showing how a graphene layer protects against water the electrical current flowing along the edge of the topological insulator indenene remains completely unaffected by external influences credit jrg bandmann pixelwg researchers have developed a groundbreaking protective coating for indenene a quantum material promising for ultrafast electronics enabling its use in air without oxidation this innovation could revolutionize the future of atomic layer electronics the race to create increasingly faster and more powerful computer chips continues as transistors their fundamental components shrink to ever smaller and more compact sizes in a few years these transistors will measure just a few atoms across  by which point the miniaturization of the silicon technology currently used will have reached its physical limits consequently the quest for alternative materials with entirely new properties is crucial for future technological advancements back in 2021 scientists from the cluster of excellence ctqmat  complexity and topology in quantum matter at the universities jmu wrzburg and tu dresden made a significant discovery topological quantum materials such as indenene which hold great promise for ultrafast energyefficient electronics the resulting extremely thin quantum semiconductors are composed of a single atom layer  in indenenes case indium atoms  and act as topological insulators conducting electricity virtually without resistance along their edges producing such a single atomic layer requires sophisticated vacuum equipment and a specific substrate material to utilize this twodimensional material in electronic components it would need to be removed from the vacuum environment however exposure to air even briefly leads to oxidation destroying its revolutionary properties and rendering it useless explains experimental physicist professor ralph claessen ctqmats wrzburg spokesperson the ctqmat wrzburg team has now managed to solve this problem their results have been published in the journal nature communications amalgamation of experimental images at the top a scanning tunneling microscopy image displays the graphenes honeycomb lattice the protective layer in the center electron microscopy shows a top view of the material indenene as a triangular lattice below it is a side view of the silicon carbide substrate it can be seen that both the indenene and the graphene consist of a single atomic layer credit jonas erhardtchristoph mder we dedicated two years to finding a method to protect the sensitive indenene layer from environmental elements using a protective coating the challenge was ensuring that this coating did not interact with the indenene layer explains cedric schmitt one of claessens doctoral students involved in the project this interaction is problematic because when different types of atoms  from the protective layer and the semiconductor for instance  meet they react chemically at the atomic level changing the material this isnt a problem with conventional silicon chips which comprise multiple atomic layers leaving sufficient layers unaffected and hence still functional a semiconductor material consisting of a single atomic layer such as indenene would normally be compromised by a protective film this posed a seemingly insurmountable challenge that piqued our research curiosity says claessen the search for a viable protective layer led them to explore van der waals materials named after the dutch physicist johannes diderik van der waals 18371923 claessen explains these twodimensional van der waals atomic layers are characterized by strong internal bonds between their atoms while only weakly bonding to the substrate this concept is akin to how pencil lead made of graphite  a form of carbon with atoms arranged in honeycomb layers  writes on paper the layers of graphene can be easily separated we aimed to replicate this characteristic using sophisticated ultrahigh vacuum equipment the wrzburg team experimented with heating silicon carbide sic as a substrate for indenene exploring the conditions needed to form graphene from it silicon carbide consists of silicon and carbon atoms heating it causes the carbon atoms to detach from the surface and form graphene says schmitt elucidating the laboratory process we then vapordeposited indium atoms which are immersed between the protective graphene layer and the silicon carbide substrate this is how the protective layer for our twodimensional quantum material indenene was formed for the first time globally claessen and his team at ctqmats wrzburg branch successfully crafted a functional protective layer for a twodimensional quantum semiconductor material without compromising its extraordinary quantum properties after analyzing the fabrication process they thoroughly tested the layers protective capabilities against oxidation and corrosion it works the sample can even be exposed to water without being affected in any way says claessen with delight the graphene layer acts like an umbrella for our indenene this breakthrough paves the way for applications involving highly sensitive semiconductor atomic layers the manufacture of ultrathin electronic components requires them to be processed in air or other chemical environments this has been made possible thanks to the discovery of this protective mechanism the team in wrzburg is now focused on identifying more van der waals materials that can serve as protective layers  and they already have a few prospects in mind the snag is that despite graphenes effective protection of atomic monolayers against environmental factors its electrical conductivity poses a risk of short circuits the wrzburg scientists are working on overcoming these challenges and creating the conditions for tomorrows atomic layer electronics the cluster of excellence ctqmat  complexity and topology in quantum matter has been jointly run by

an artists rendering of nitrogen vacancy centers in a diamond anvil cell which can detect the expulsion of magnetic fields by a highpressure superconductor credit ella marushchenko harvard scientists have made a significant advance in highpressure physics by creating a tool that directly images superconducting materials under extreme conditions facilitating new discoveries in the field of superconducting hydrides hydrogen like many of us acts weird under pressure theory predicts that when crushed by the weight of more than a million times our atmosphere this light abundant normally gaseous element first becomes a metal and even more strangely a superconductor  a material that conducts electricity with no resistance scientists have been eager to understand and eventually harness superconducting hydrogenrich compounds called hydrides for practical applications  from levitating trains to particle detectors but studying the behavior of these and other materials under enormous sustained pressures is anything but practical and accurately measuring those behaviors ranges somewhere between a nightmare and impossible like the calculator did for arithmetic and chatgpt has done for writing fiveparagraph essays harvard researchers think they have a foundational tool for the thorny problem of how to measure and image the behavior of hydride superconductors at high pressure publishing in nature they report creatively integrating quantum sensors into a standard pressureinducing device enabling direct readouts of the pressurized materials electrical and magnetic properties the innovation came from a longstanding collaboration between professor of physics norman yao 09 phd 14 and boston university professor and former harvard postdoctoral fellow christopher laumann 03 who together broke from their theorist backgrounds into the practical considerations of highpressure measurement several years ago the standard way to study hydrides under extreme pressures is with an instrument called a diamond anvil cell which squeezes a small amount of material between two brilliantcut diamond interfaces to detect when a sample has been squashed enough to go superconducting physicists typically look for a dual signature a drop in electrical resistance to zero as well as the repulsion of any nearby magnetic field aka the meissner effect this why a ceramic superconductor when cooled with liquid nitrogen will hover over a magnet the problem lies in capturing those details in order to apply the requisite pressure the sample must be held in place by a gasket that evenly distributes the squishing and then enclosed in a chamber this makes it hard to see whats happening inside so physicists have had to use workarounds that involve multiple samples to separately measure different effects the field of superconducting hydrides has been a little bit controversial partly because the measurement techniques at high pressures are just so limited yao said the problem is that you cant just stick a sensor or a probe inside because everythings closed off and at very high pressures that makes accessing local pieces of information from inside the chamber extremely difficult as a result nobody has really observed the dual signatures of superconductivity in a single sample to solve the issue the researchers designed and tested a clever retrofit they integrated a thin layer of sensors made out of naturally occurring defects in the diamonds atomic crystal lattice directly onto the surface of the diamond anvil they used these effective quantum sensors called nitrogen vacancy centers to image regions inside the chamber while the sample is pressurized and crosses into superconducting territory to prove their concept they worked with cerium hydride a material known to become a superconductor at about a million atmospheres of pressure or what physicists call the megabar regime the new tool could help the field not only by enabling discovery of new superconducting hydrides but also by allowing easier access to those coveted characteristics in existing materials for continued study you can imagine that because youre now making something in a nitrogen vacancy diamond anvil cell and you can immediately see that this area is now superconducting this area is not you could optimize your synthesis and come up with a way to make much better samples laumann said reference imaging the meissner effect in hydride superconductors using quantum sensors by p bhattacharyya w chen x huang s chatterjee b huang b kobrin y lyu t j smart m block e wang z wang w wu s hsieh h ma s mandyam b chen e davis z m geballe c zu v struzhkin r jeanloz j e moore t cui g galli b i halperin c r laumann and n y yao 28 february 2024 nature doi 101038s41586024070267 the us department of energy supported this research,Physics
a view from inside the omega target chamber during a directdrive inertial fusion experiment at the university of rochesters laboratory for laser energetics scientists fired 28 kilojoules of laser energy at small capsules filled with deuterium and tritium fuel causing the capsules to implode and produce a plasma hot enough to initiate fusion reactions between the fuel nuclei the temperatures achieved at the heart of these implosions are as high as 100 million degrees celsius 180 million degrees fahrenheit the speed at which the implosion takes place is typically between 500 and 600 kilometers per second 11 to 135 million miles per hour the pressures at the core are up to 80 billion times greater than atmospheric pressure credit university of rochester laboratory for laser energetics photo  eugene kowaluk researchers at the university of rochesters laboratory for laser energetics lle have led experiments showcasing an efficient spark plug for directdrive approaches to inertial confinement fusion icf in a pair of studies featured in nature physics the team shares their findings and details the potential for scaling up these methods aiming for successful fusion in a future facility lle is the largest universitybased us department of energy program and hosts the omega laser system which is the largest academic laser in the world but still almost one hundredth the energy of the national ignition facility nif at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california with omega rochester scientists completed several successful attempts to fire 28 kilojoules of laser energy at small capsules filled with deuterium and tritium fuel causing the capsules to implode and produce a plasma hot enough to initiate fusion reactions between the fuel nuclei the experiments caused fusion reactions that produced more energy than the amount of energy in the central hot plasma the omega experiments use direct laser illumination of the capsule and differ from the indirect drive approach used on the nif when using the indirect drive approach the laser light is converted into xrays that in turn drive the capsule implosion the nif used indirect drive to irradiate a capsule with xrays using about 2000 kilojoules of laser energy this led to a 2022 breakthrough at nif in achieving fusion ignitiona fusion reaction that creates a net gain of energy from the target generating more fusion energy than the internal energy content of where the fusion takes place is an important threshold says lead author of the first paper connor williams 23 phd physics and astronomy now a staff scientist at sandia national labs in radiation and icf target design thats a necessary requirement for anything you want to accomplish later on such as burning plasmas or achieving ignition by showing they can achieve this level of implosion performance with just 28 kilojoules of laser energy the rochester team is excited by the prospect of applying directdrive methods to lasers with more energy demonstrating a spark plug is an important step however omega is too small to compress enough fuel to get to ignition if you can eventually create the spark plug and compress fuel direct drive has a lot of characteristics that are favorable for fusion energy compared to indirectdrive says varchas gopalaswamy 21 phd mechanical engineering the lle scientist who led the second study that explores the implications of using the directdrive approach on megajouleclass lasers similar to the size of the nif after scaling the omega results to a few megajoules of laser energies the fusion reactions are predicted to become selfsustaining a condition called burning plasmas gopalaswamy says that directdrive icf is a promising approach for achieving thermonuclear ignition and net energy in laser fusion a major factor contributing to the success of these recent experiments is the development of a novel implosion design method based on statistical predictions and validated by machine learning algorithms says riccardo betti lles chief scientist and the robert l mccrory professor in the department of mechanical engineering and in the department of physics and astronomy these predictive models allow us to narrow the pool of promising candidate designs before carrying out valuable experiments references demonstration of hotspot fuel gain exceeding unity

rice university researchers have discovered a novel 3d crystalline metal that locks electrons in place due to a unique interplay of quantum correlations and the materials geometric structure this discovery highlights the role of flat electronic bands in determining a materials properties and sets the stage for further explorations into quantum materials with pyrochlore lattice structures credit scitechdailycom scientists at rice university have uncovered a firstofitskind material a 3d crystalline metal in which quantum correlations and the geometry of the crystal structure combine to frustrate the movement of electrons and lock them in place the find is detailed in a study published in nature physics the paper also describes the theoretical design principle and experimental methodology that guided the research team to the material one part copper two parts vanadium and four parts sulfur the alloy features a 3d pyrochlore lattice consisting of cornersharing tetrahedra we look for materials where there are potentially new states of matter or new exotic features that havent been discovered said study cocorresponding author ming yi a rice experimental physicist quantum materials are a likely place to look especially if they host strong electron interactions that give rise to quantum entanglement entanglement leads to strange electronic behaviors including frustrating the movement of electrons to the point where they become locked in place this quantum interference effect is analogous to waves rippling across the surface of a pond and meeting headon yi said the collision creates a standing wave that does not move in the case of geometrically frustrated lattice materials its the electronic wave functions that destructively interfere rice university postdoctoral research associate jianwei huang with the laboratory apparatus he used to conduct angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments on a coppervanadium alloy the experiments showed the alloy is the first known material in which 3d crystal structure and strong quantum interactions frustrate the movement of electrons and lock them in place resulting in a flat electronic band credit jeff fitlowrice university electron localization in metals and semimetals produces flat electronic bands or flat bands in recent years physicists have found that the geometric arrangement of atoms in some 2d crystals like kagome lattices can also produce flat bands the new study provides empirical evidence of the effect in a 3d material using an experimental technique called angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy or arpes yi and study lead author jianwei huang a postdoctoral researcher in her lab detailed the band structure of the coppervanadiumsulfur material and found it hosted a flat band that is unique in several ways it turns out that both types of physics are important in this material yi said the geometric frustration aspect was there as theory had predicted the pleasant surprise was that there were also correlation effects that produced the flat band at the fermi level where it can actively participate in determining the physical properties jianwei huang credit jeff fitlowrice university in solidstate matter electrons occupy quantum states that are divided into bands these electronic bands can be imagined as rungs on a ladder and electrostatic repulsion limits the number of electrons that can occupy each rung fermi level an inherent property of materials and a crucial one for determining their band structure refers to the energy level of the highest occupied position on the ladder rice theoretical physicist and study cocorresponding author qimiao si whose research group identified the coppervanadium alloy and its pyrochlore crystal structure as being a possible host for combined frustration effects from geometry and strong electron interactions likened the discovery to finding a new continent its the very first work to really show not only this cooperation between geometric and interactiondriven frustration but also the next stage which is getting electrons to be in the same space at the top of the energy ladder where theres a maximal chance of their reorganizing into interesting and potentially functional new phases si said he said the predictive methodology or design principle that his research group used in the study may also prove useful to theorists who study quantum materials with other crystal lattice structures the pyrochlore is not the only game in town si said this is a new design principle that allows theorists to predictively identify materials in which flat bands arise due to strong electron correlations yi said there is also plenty of room for further experimental exploration of pyrochlore crystals this is just the tip of the iceberg she said this is 3d which is new and just given how many surprising findings there have been on kagome lattices im envisioning that there could be equally or maybe even more exciting discoveries to be made in the pyrochlore materials reference nonfermi liquid behaviour in a correlated flatband pyrochlore lattice by jianwei huang lei chen yuefei huang chandan setty

stanford universitys research team has made a significant breakthrough in quantum technology by improving niobiumbased qubits to match leading alternatives this advancement highlights niobiums potential to operate at higher temperatures and wider ranges opening new possibilities for quantum computing credit scitechdailycom for years niobium was considered an underperformer when it came to superconducting qubits now scientists supported by qnext have found a way to engineer a highperforming niobiumbased qubit and so take advantage of niobiums superior qualities when it comes to quantum technology niobium is making a comeback for the past 15 years niobium has been sitting on the bench after experiencing a few mediocre atbats as a core qubit material qubits are the fundamental components of quantum devices one qubit type relies on superconductivity to process information touted for its superior qualities as a superconductor niobium has always a promising candidate for quantum technologies however scientists found niobium difficult to engineer as a core qubit component and so it was relegated to the second string on team superconducting qubit now a group led by stanford universitys david schuster has demonstrated a way to create niobiumbased qubits that rival the stateoftheart for their class this was a promising first foray having resurrected niobium junctions  with niobiumbased qubits broad operational reach we open up a whole new set of capabilities for future quantum technologies  david schuster stanford university weve shown that niobium is relevant again expanding the possibilities of what we can do with qubits said alexander anferov of the university of chicagos physical science division one of the lead scientists of the result the teams work is published in physical review applied and was supported in part by qnext a us department of energy doe national quantum information science research center led by does argonne national laboratory by harnessing niobiums standout features scientists will be able to expand the capabilities of quantum computers networks and sensors these quantum technologies draw on quantum physics to process information in ways that outclass their traditional counterparts and are expected to improve areas as varied as medicine finance and communication the josephson junction is the informationprocessing heart of the superconducting qubit pictured here is the niobium josephson junction engineered by david schuster of stanford university and his team their junction design has resurrected niobium as a viable option as a core qubit material credit alexander anferovthe university of chicagos pritzker nanofabrication facility when it comes to superconducting qubits aluminum has ruled the roost aluminumbased superconducting qubits can store information for a relatively long time before the data inevitably disintegrates these longer coherence times mean more time for processing information the longest coherence times for an aluminumbased superconducting qubit are a few hundredmillionths of a second by contrast in recent years the best niobiumbased qubits yielded coherence times that are 100 times shorter  a few hundred billionths of a second despite that short qubit lifetime niobium held attractions a niobiumbased qubit can operate at higher temperatures than its aluminum counterpart and so would require less cooling it can also operate across an eighttimesgreater frequency range and a massive 18000timeswider magnetic field range compared to aluminumbased qubits expanding the menu of uses for the superconductingqubit family in one respect there was no contest between the two materials niobiums operating range trounced aluminums but for years the short coherence time made the niobiumbased qubit a nonstarter no one really made that many qubits out of niobium junctions because they were limited by their coherence anferov said but our group wanted to make a qubit that could work at higher temperatures and a greater frequency range  at 1 k and 100 gigahertz and for both of those properties aluminum is not sufficient we needed something else so the team had another look at niobium specifically they had a look at the niobium josephson junction the josephson junction is the informationprocessing heart of the superconducting qubit in classical information processing data comes in bits that are either 0s or 1s in quantum information processing a qubit is a mixture of 0 and 1 the superconducting qubits information lives as a mixture of 0 and 1 inside the junction the longer the junction can sustain the information in that mixed state the better the junction and the better the qubit the josephson junction is structured like a sandwich consisting of a layer of nonconducting material squeezed between two layers of superconducting metal a conductor is a material that provides easy passage for electrical current a superconductor kicks it up a notch it carries electrical current with zero resistance electromagnetic energy flows between the junctions outer layers in the mixed quantum state the typical trusty aluminum josephson junction is made of two layers of aluminum and a middle layer of aluminum oxide a typical niobium junction is made of two layers of niobium and a middle layer of niobium oxide schusters group found that the junctions niobium oxide layer sapped the energy required to sustain quantum states they also identified the niobium junctions supporting architecture as a big source of energy loss causing the qubits quantum state to fizzle out the teams breakthrough involved both a new junction arrangement and a new fabrication technique the new arrangement called on a familiar friend aluminum the design did away with the energysucking niobium oxide and instead of two distinct materials it used three the result was a lowloss trilayer junction  niobium aluminum aluminum oxide aluminum niobium we did this bestofbothworlds approach anferov said the thin layer of aluminum can inherit the superconducting properties of the niobium nearby this way we can use the proven chemical properties of aluminum and still have the superconducting properties of niobium the groups fabrication technique involved removing scaffolding that supported the niobium junction in previous schemes they found a way to maintain the junctions structure while getting rid of the lossinducing extraneous material that hampered coherence in previous designs it turns out just getting rid of the garbage helped anferov said after incorporating their new junction into superconducting qubits the schuster group achieved a coherence time of 62 millionths of a second 150 times longer than its bestperforming niobium predecessors the qubits also exhibited a quality factor  an index of how well a qubit stores energy  of 257 x 105 a 100fold improvement over previous niobiumbased qubits and competitive with aluminumbased qubit quality factors weve made this junction that still has the nice properties of niobium and weve improved the loss properties of the junction anferov said we can directly outperform any aluminum qubit because aluminum is an inferior material in many ways i now have a qubit that doesnt die at higher temperatures which is the big kicker the results will likely elevate niobiums

if openai cant keep its own team together what hope is there for the rest of the industry plus aigenerated slop is taking over the internet dont get techscape delivered to your inbox sign up for the full article here everything happens so much im in seoul for the international ai summit the halfyear followup to last years bletchley park ai safety summit the full sequel will be in paris this autumn while you read this the first day of events will have just wrapped up  though in keeping with the reduced fuss this time round that was merely a virtual leaders meeting when the date was set for this summit  alarmingly late in the day for say a journalist with two preschool children for whom four days away from home is a juggling act  it was clear that there would be a lot to cover the hot ai summer is upon us the inaugural ai safety summit at bletchley park in the uk last year announced an international testing framework for ai models after calls  for a sixmonth pause in development of powerful systems there has been no pause the bletchley declaration signed by uk us eu china and others hailed the enormous global opportunities from ai but also warned of its potential for causing catastrophic harm it also secured a commitment from big tech firms including openai google and mark zuckerbergs meta to cooperate with governments on testing their models before they are released while the uk and us have established national ai safety institutes the industrys development of ai has continued  openai released gpt4o the o stands for omni for free online a day later google previewed a new ai assistant called project astra as well as updates to its gemini model last month meta released new versions of its own ai model llama  and in march the ai startup anthropic formed by former openai staff who disagreed with altmans approach updated its claude model then the weekend before the summit kicked off everything kicked off at openai as well most eyecatchingly perhaps the company found itself in a row with scarlett johansson over one of the voice options available in the new iteration of chatgpt having approached the actor to lend her voice to its new assistant an offer she declined twice openai launched chatgpt4o with sky talking through its new capabilities the similarity to johansson was immediately obvious to all even before ceo sam altman tweeted her after the presentation the name of the spike jonze film in which johansson voiced a superintelligent ai despite denying the similarity the sky voice option has been removed more importantly though the two men leading the companynonprofitsecret villainous organisations superalignment team  which was devoted to ensuring that its efforts to build a superintelligence dont end humanity  quit first to go was ilya sutskever the cofounder of the organisation and leader of the boardroom coup which temporarily and ineffectually ousted altman his exit raised eyebrows but it was hardly unforeseen you come at the king you best not miss then on friday jan leike sutskevers colead of superalignment also left and had a lot more to say a former senior employee at openai has said the company behind chatgpt is prioritising shiny products over safety revealing that he quit after a disagreement over key aims reached breaking point leike detailed the reasons for his departure in a thread on x posted on friday in which he said safety culture had become a lower priority over the past years safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products he wrote these problems are quite hard to get right and i am concerned we arent on a trajectory to get there he wrote adding that it was getting harder and harder for his team to do its research building smarterthanhuman machines is an inherently dangerous endeavour openai is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity leike wrote adding that openai must become a safetyfirst agi artificial general intelligence company leikes resignation note was a rare insight into dissent at the group which has previously been portrayed as almost singleminded in its pursuit of its  which sometimes means sam altmans  goals when the charismatic chief executive was fired it was reported that almost all staff had accepted offers from microsoft to follow him to a new ai lab set up under the house of gates which also has the largest external stake in openais corporate subsidiary even when a number of staff quit to form anthropic a rival ai company that distinguishes itself by talking up how much it focuses on safety the amount of shittalking was kept to a minimum it turns out surprise thats not because everyone loves each other and has nothing bad to say from kelsey piper at vox i have seen the extremely restrictive offboarding agreement that contains nondisclosure and nondisparagement provisions former openai employees are subject to it forbids them for the rest of their lives from criticizing their former employer even acknowledging that the nda exists is a violation of it if a departing employee declines to sign the document or if they violate it they can lose all vested equity they earned during their time at the company which is likely worth millions of dollars one former employee daniel kokotajlo who posted that he quit openai due to losing confidence that it would behave responsibly around the time of agi has confirmed publicly that he had to surrender what would have likely turned out to be a huge sum of money in order to quit without signing the document barely a day later altman said the clawback provisions should never have been something we had in any documents he added we have never clawed back anyones vested equity nor will we do that if people do not sign a separation agreement this is on me and one of the few times ive been genuinely embarrassed running openai i did not know this was happening and i should have capitalisation models own altman didnt address the wider allegations of a strict and broad nda and while he promised to fix the clawback provision nothing was said about the other incentives carrot and stick offered to employees to sign the exit paperwork as setdressing goes its perfect altman has been a significant proponent of state and interstate regulation of ai now we see why it might be necessary if openai one of the biggest and bestresourced ai labs in the world which claims that safety is at the root of everything it does cant even keep its own team together then what hope is there for the rest of the industry its fun to watch a term of art developing in front of your eyes post had junk mail email had spam the ai world has slop slop is what you get when you shove artificial intelligencegenerated material up on the web for anyone to view unlike a chatbot the slop isnt interactive and is rarely intended to actually answer readers questions or serve their needs but like spam its overall effect is negative the lost time and effort of users who now have to wade through slop to find the content theyre actually seeking far outweighs the profit to the slop creator im keen to help popularise the term for much the same reasons as simon willison the developer who brought its emergence to my attention its crucial to have easy ways to talk about ai done badly to preserve the ability to acknowledge that ai can be done well the existence of spam implies emails that you want to receive the existence of slop entails ai content that is desired for me thats content ive generated myself or at least that im expecting to be aigenerated no one cares about the dream you had last night and no one cares about the response you got from chatgpt keep it to yourself dont get techscape delivered

amber rudd will tell forum including facebook twitter and youtube that they share responsibility for tackling terrorism amber rudd will urge social media companies to do more to remove online terrorist content during a series of meetings with tech giants including twitter and facebook after a sharp increase in the number of plots foiled in the uk the home secretary will warn that extremists have exploited web platforms as way of spreading their hateful messages when she attends the global internet forum to counter terrorism in silicon valley theresa may had previously warned that the fight against islamic state was shifting from the battlefield to the internet when she attended the g7 meeting in sicily in the wake of the manchester terror attack world leaders called on internet service providers to substantially increase their efforts to crackdown on extremist content the responsibility for tackling this threat at every level lies with both governments and with industry we have a shared interest we want to protect our citizens and keep the free and open internet we all love rudd is expected to tell the internet providers she will claim that the forum which was created by facebook microsoft twitter and youtube marks an opportunity to start turning the tide on the issue it comes after a 21yearold from slough taha hussain was found guilty of encouraging people to instigate prepare or commit acts of terror including through online content after he was arrested disturbing photographs were found on his phone alongside a youtube channel that he had created which claimed that no one should feel sorry for the deaths of nonmuslims and the wrong kind of muslims the channel broadcast images of militants in battle firing a range of weapons and blowing up vehicles and buildings and included the black flag associated with isis detectives also discovered that hussain had sent a number of videos containing extremist propaganda via whatsapp extremist posts like the ones hussain posted and shared have the power to influence other people and particularly those who may be young and impressionable or vulnerable for a variety of reasons said det ch sup kath barnes head of ctp south east this could lead to those influenced individuals committing acts of terror which clearly has devastating effects on communities the individual and their family and friends rudd met tech companies after khalid masood drove a car into tourists gathered on westminster bridge and then murdered pc keith palmer at the gates of parliament before being shot dead after the meeting she said her starting point was that people who want to do harm should not be able to use the internet or social media to further their cause i want to make sure we are doing everything we can to stop this she said warning that terrorist propaganda online was a very real and evolving threat the uk government was cited by tech companies as they moved towards creating the forum monika bickert director of global policy management at facebook and brian fishman the companys counterterrorism policy manager said they had been learning a lot through briefings from agencies in different countries about isis and alqaida propaganda mechanisms the companies which have previously come under intense criticism for not taking the issue seriously enough said the forum would aim to create new technological solutions that could help remove terrorist content they would also commission research to help them reach policy decisions and work with counterterrorism experts as well as governments civil society groups and academics the largest companies have promised to work with smaller outfits to support their efforts the prime minister chose to focus on the issue of terrorism threats both at the g7 in sicily when she spoke about social media companies and in the g20 in hamburg when she spoke about how to disrupt the financing of extremist groups that followed a series of terror attacks in the uk in quick succession including the westminster attack the manchester bombing in which 22 people were killed and the london bridge attacks that resulted in eight deaths and 48 being injured the home office admitted that there had been a sharp increase in the number of terror attacks foiled by the uk security agencies with five plots disrupted in just two months compared with 12 in the period from 2013 to march 2017 it has been reported that mi5 is juggling around 500 active investigations at one time with 3000 people of interest however silicon valley is expected to strongly resist rudds demands hany farid senior adviser to the counter extremism project said they tech companies are under intense pressure from the eu from the media from advertisers and the public but they continue to stall and do a good job on pr but not a good job on actually implementing these changes farid a computer science professor at dartmouth college compared the efforts on terrorism to tech firms slowness to take action against content promoting child abuse and exploitation in the mid2000s im highly sceptical of the pr efforts that were seeing from tech he said it is not real action it is trying to stave off legislation both at the eu the uk and here in the states at the first forums first workshop on tuesday the tech giants will discuss strategies to disrupt terrorists ability to use the internet the companies said in a joint blogpost the statement cited goals to share best practices and technology conduct and fund new research and recruit other firms to join the effort critics have argued that private corporations are not well equipped to tackle such a complex problem on their own theres an immediate conflict of interest which is these companies want to make money said r karl rethemeyer professor of public administration and policy at the university at albany the way that they capture information  is built around a commercial purpose thats really very different than trying to discern what ones political agenda is michael smith a terrorism analyst said that he hoped rudd would call them out for their unwillingness to enable policies which would more effectively deter exploitations of their technologies by terrorists the firms he said have generally opposed efforts to make it easier to identify and locate users which could lead regulators in europe and the us to try to force them to be more proactive in the way they track people although the companies have pledged to share information as part of their joint counterterrorism initiative there are also profit motives in limiting such collaboration the level of competition between those platforms is intense said rethemeyer theres no particular commercial reason for them to share pressure from officials like rudd could encourage the companies to adopt internal policy changes in an effort to preempt regulations and other efforts to hold them legally liable there are however growing concerns that in the process the social media platforms will increasingly censor people and violate users free speech rights said sophia cope staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation the potential for overbroad takedowns is just incredibly great particularly when you get into those grey areas of political speech dissenting speech religious speech where there is room for debate in recent months facebook has repeatedly come under fire for censoring journalists and activists in the name of combating terrorism often reversing their decisions in the wake of negative media coverage while some regulators have pushed for greater technical solutions to weed out terrorist propaganda there are also worries that machine learning and artificial intelligence fail to understand the context of content and can block speech that should not be censored its not so simple at just throwing automated technology at the problem said cope the technology just isnt there yet to be able to sift out what theyre trying to target from what is considered legitimate speech,Computing

any organization with interconnected systems must prioritize integration security in order to safeguard sensitive business and customer information but with so many options for securing integrations picking the right combination of features and protocols could make or break your security in this blog post ill explore the best practices to protect your data in the interconnected landscape so join me on this journey to ensure your data remains safe and secure throughout its integration adventure integration security is a concept that describes measures and protocols for securing the transmission and processing of data between different platforms companies or teams the main goals for integration security include an insecure integration paints a massive bullseye on your systems attracting cybercriminals and unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive data this could lead to severe financial losses reputational damage lawsuits data manipulation service disruptions data corruption or even data theft one famous example of the negative impacts of integration security is solarwinds a system monitoring software provider  in 2020 a breach of the solarwinds application orion crippled a lot of customers and enterprises using the product companies impacted by the hack include microsoft firsteye and a myriad of us government agencies in total 14 of the fortune 1000 were affected by the breach as well as millions of customers worldwide so if hackers could get past the security of a multinational company like solarwinds id imagine theyd sashay all over your unsecured integration system the main challenges to integration security include many of the above challenges we discussed exist for integrations across departments companies teams and applications intracompany integrations must follow internally approved security protocols interwoven with the companys culture but the security threats challenges and potential risks that exist when you connect with applications across company borders are exponential for instance when connecting with a thirdparty vendor or msp mssp their lax security practices might make you a prime target for a solarwindslike attack mentioned earlier so when integrating in an msp environment you need to filter out internal and external information this involves documenting the data you should share and what you should keep private you also need to assess the security practices of the companies you want to integrate with this starts from their approach to compliance or regulatory requirements down to the authentication protocols and roles on a personnel level you need to evaluate how the admin on the other end of the connection addresses security as well as their response mechanisms to unusual activity you can enhance the security of integrations by following a few best practices here are some key factors to consider when selecting a secure integration solution integration security is evolving to meet the growing challenges of safeguarding data and ensuring seamless information transfer and migration the first thing that comes to mind is artificial intelligence going forward organizations will use aipowered threat detection systems to monitor data flows patterns and anomalies in realtime  these systems can use machine learning algorithms to detect potential security breaches unauthorized access and suspicious activities enabling swift responses to mitigate risks another critical consideration in integration security is zero trust architecture zta zta is a concept that functions under the assumption that no entity whether inside or outside the network can be trusted inherently it enforces strict access controls multifactor authentication etc thereby significantly reducing the attack surface and enhancing overall security i also need to point you toward containerization which involves the use of container technologies like docker and kubernetes for deploying and managing applications containerization will simplify container isolation vulnerability scanning and runtime protection integration security is your shield that will help you fortify the bridges between various systems and ensure your data remains safe and secure opinions expressed by dzone contributors are their own,Computing
to explore status page aggregation well share our experience building a status page aggregator tool  statusgator which has been availble for eight years we will share our technical insights and also share how you can build your own aggregator photo by markus spiske most it infrastructure relies heavily on hosted services cloud applications and thirdparty software teams might use various services whether popular cloud services like aws azure or google cloud customer service tools or marketing platforms like hubspot or salesforce whenever any of the services experience downtime it might take a while for the tech team to understand that an outage of a thirdparty service causes the problem visiting each services status page individually can be cumbersome surprisingly some it helpdesk teams maintain a list of these pages in a google sheets file and visit each link manually to check the status a status page aggregator can help by consolidating all this information into a single more manageable internal page status page aggregation isnt a replacement for traditional monitoring software but it can certainly complement it with status aggregation the data is gathered from official status pages it means that this data is based on what the service providers officially report it includes scheduled maintenance ongoing outages and performance issues depending on the transparency of the provider  this data might not always be accurate because it really depends on how well each provider manages and reports incidents in our research we found that circleci is good at this but some other cloud providers arent as careful or regular with their reporting despite that some data may not be accurate and the tech team doesnt have to visit each status page when an issue arises not all status page aggregators are the same or have the same features but the technology behind them is always consistent we find its built on a threecomponent system numerous automated checkers or bots are at the heart of status page aggregation technology these checkers routinely visit the status pages of various services gathering and relaying data back to the central system these checkers adapt to changes in status page data to collect uptodate information they are typically capable of interacting with the apis of significant services utilizing undocumented apis or even resorting to html scraping there are many different status page providers out there each with its own format for presenting data therefore automated checkers need the capability to interpret and process information not only from widely used formats but also from custom status pages created by providers who create their own status aggregators play a crucial role in standardizing data due to the wide range of formats and terms used across different service status pages they convert various status formats into a uniform display making it easier to compare information from different services the process of data normalization involves sorting service statuses into several clear categories while this may require some judgment to interpret different terms it ensures comprehensive coverage of all events for instance a status described as degraded might be grouped under a warning category whereas severe could indicate a complete service outage this categorization helps in sending users notifications that are both relevant and specific to their needs ensuring they stay informed about crucial service disruptions once the data is gathered and standardized all the service statuses are shown together on one page for easy viewing the system checks each status page for updates every few minutes offering both passive and active updates passive updates occur when the status pages themselves are updated while active updates involve proactively sending notifications to users based on their chosen settings like getting specific alerts for certain service disruptions its common for teams to display an internal status page on a tv in their office providing a constant realtime overview of service statuses additionally proactive updates can be integrated with other monitoring systems this is often achieved through apis or by sending messages directly to communication platforms like slack ms teams discord etc these integrations ensure that the relevant teams are swiftly alerted in their preferred environments allowing for immediate response and action when service disruptions occur there are two ways to get a status page aggregation ready solutions or building your tool a diy status page aggregator usually involves two key elements to get started the checker and the display youll need to determine where to host your status page it should be a webpage on your server or a service like statuspageio with the ready solutions the checker data normalization and display are taken care of for you these solutions include statusgator statusticker and some others another solution that is worth mentioning is downdetector it collects user feedback on service availability rather than the official information from status pages in conclusion the role of status page aggregation is to enhance incident communication and monitoring processes this article has outlined three key components of a typical status page aggregator and explored two distinct approaches to its implementation if
