taking steps to prevent problems is the basis for proactive gardening i had a meeting recently in which i was describing why my garden had been doing so well in spite of the very strange weather and conditions experienced this season conditions perfect for all types of pests and diseases as i listed my reasons why he chimed in thats the difference between proactive and reactive gardening the concept made instant sense and its one ive practiced for years i had just never put it into such practical logical terms before the steps i had taken to ensure a healthy garden were all in an effort to prevent future problems just as a person might take care of themselves with diet exercise and vitamins i credit this proactive practice to knowing the benefits of starting off with a healthy garden and maintaining vigilance along the way there are certainly plenty of chemicals that can be applied after the fact that in many cases solve pest problems or control plant diseases but at what price as i went on to share some of the steps in my proactive gardening practice i discussed the following examples start with great soil ive been accused of having tv soil in my garden set of fresh from the garden and its true my soil is close to dream soil and thats by design my plants must not only survive they must thrive i know that my best chance of making that happen is to provide the best growing environment the focus is to create the best structure and drainage possible and fill the growing beds with plenty of compost and manure keep the garden clean the only thing i want to see growing in my garden are the plants i intended to to be there this means ive always got an eye towards the ground scouting for weeds they dont stay around long in my garden weeds are a haven for disease carrying pests if any plant material does start to shed a leaf or two or a plant shows early signs of a disease problem i either remove the infected material or in some cases the entire plant control water as vital as water is to the life of the garden it can also be responsible for its demise water is a major facilitator of the spread of plant disease at and above the soil line by minimizing the amount of moisture staying on the plants you minimize the chance of water spreading disease to the plants this is accomplished by using drip irrigation systems whenever possible to keep water off of foliage another technique is to water early in the day so foliage has time to dry out and dont over water consider watering on an asneeded basis or use a water timer to ensure plants are getting enough water if you are away for an extended period mulch the benefits of mulch are clearly visible in the garden for example i have beds where i started to mulch but didnt finish for some reason the plants that were mulched are always larger fuller and weeks ahead of the same plants in the unmulched portion mulch also helps keep soilborne diseases from splashing onto plant foliage keeps soil temperatures even weeds from germinating and creates a healthier environment for plants to grow mulch is also a great way to improve the soil by incorporating it into your beds at the end of the growing season inspect a key step in maintaining a healthy garden is constant vigilance in observing daytoday changes this does not mean that you are required to spend every day in the garden although i recommend it it simply means pay attention to whats going on the earlier you are able to detect adverse changes the less severe your reaction needs to be anticipate when i spray a chemical in the garden it is to prevent plant disease or promote the health and defense mechanisms in plants once plant diseases find their way into your garden they can be difficult to control at best many fungal and bacterial diseases can be prevented by spraying plants with a baking soda mixture or a coppersulfur based solution every week or so while the plant is growing however it is important to note this should be done before disease becomes apparent another tactic i use is to spray vegetable plants with a special harpin protein every couple of weeks during their active growth period this protein marketed as messenger has been found to increase the immune and disease fighting resistance in many plants studies as well as personal observation seem to indicate healthier bushier plants and higher yields because harpin protein is naturally occurring in plants nontoxic and completely safe to use i like the results i am seeing and i feel comfortable using it if all of this sounds a lot like ipm integrated pest management id say youre right there are a lot of similarities this explains why i like ipm so much aside from the similarities proactive gardening seems to sound much more gardenesque

almost any plant problem can be rectified by obtaining a soil sample report from your extension service whenever im diagnosing a plant problem on the radio or facetoface my first question is usually have you done a soil test the answer is almost always no which is a shame because many plant problems can be easily rectified if one only knew the condition of their soil for starters you must know the ph of the soil the ph is a relative range from 0 14 which measures the acidity or alkalinity a reading below 70 indicates an acidic soil while readings above 70 are alkaline most plants grow best in a range of 60 70 next you should understand why a soil analysis is important to having a healthy lawn and garden in order for plants to thrive they need certain levels of nutrients many of these are found naturally in the native soil however there are major and minor as well as micronutrients that are all used by plants in various quantities the soil analysis will tell you the levels of these nutrients found in your soil knowing the ph and nutrient levels are both important you can have the perfect balance of nutrients but if the ph level is outside the range of preference for what you are growing many of the nutrients will be unavailable because the plants will not be able to absorb them conversely if you have the perfect ph but lack the appropriate nutrients your plants will perform below their potential soil tests are available from a number of sources you can purchase kits from a garden center online or through mail order sources however none compare in quality or accuracy to the results you get through your county extension service for the money the best value comes from these a soil analysis conducted by the extension service is more comprehensive as well the report includes a reading of the soil ph and measures the major and minor nutrient levels one of the best features of this report is that it also provides the suggested amounts and type of nutrients to add to your existing soil to bring into optimal levels for growing the plants or crops you have specified joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
roots are a good indication of the health of a plant spring fever will strike at any moment are you ready for it you can be if you follow a few simple guidelines as you head out to the nursery for that next big purchase bringing home healthy disease free plants will make your garden look better and make your gardening experience more enjoyable most plant buyers cannot overcome the urge to purchase plants that are in full bloom in the nursery who can resist the temptation to bring home the most beautiful plants you and me i hope plants already in bloom require a lot of energy to sustain those blooms next time choose plants that have flower buds but are not yet in bloom this way you can get the plants in the ground and allow time for the roots to establish a bit first even better pinch off the flower blooms completely when you plant theyll come back and the roots will receive the plants energy resulting in more established plants that look even better first check the roots if it is a woody ornamental tree or shrub dont be afraid to pull it from its container healthy plants will have roots that are light in color they will appear evenly distributed without looking crammed stay clear of plants that have dark roots or ones that have roots that spiral around the inside of the container these plants are pot bound and may have a difficult time establishing in the landscape inspect each plant for signs of pests as many hide on the underside of the leaves look closely as you might miss them at first glance you might have a clue of their presence if you see leaf stippling small black flecks or a sticky residue especially on the underside avoid purchasing plants that appear to be leggy or stretched these plants have been growing in light that was insufficient for their needs although they may recover they have been stressed your goal for a great looking plant long term is to purchase plants that have not been under any apparent stress foliage that is abnormally light may be a good indication that the plant was over or under watered these extremes exhibit similar symptoms either case is undesirable and adds additional stress to the plant another good way to reduce plant damage caused by diseases is to purchase plant varieties that are disease resistant this does not ensure that plants will be immune from any particular disease but it does indicate that the plant displays characteristics which minimize the impact of a certain disease these plants have a genetic ability to resist significant damage to a certain disease or pathogen be sure to recognize that resistant doesnt mean immune what qualifies the plant to be considered resistant is the relatively small degree of impact that a certain pathogen has on that particular plant variety the best way to know if you are buying a disease resistant variety is to do your homework the internet books newsletters magazines and your county extension service are all good sources your local county extension service is also a great source for information and is specific to your area and zone the best way to keep unhealthy plants out of your garden is to leave your emotions at home next time you head for the garden center apply tough love when shopping for plants in the long run youll be glad you did joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
all turf grasses share some common maintenance characteristics id like to start this article by sharing the common characteristics and needs of all turf grasses for this time of year in the southeast irrigation in the absence of rainfall your lawn should get about one inch of water per week however you wont know how long it takes for you to deliver that amount of water until you test this for yourself get out some tuna cans etc to see how long it takes to fill the cans this is an inch be sure to place several cans around as irrigation systems are often inconsistent from one zone to the next assuming no runoff irrigate your lawn ideally once per week for the amount of time determined above deep watering less frequently ie one inch once per week encourages deep root growth and better drought tolerance mowing when mowing your lawn never remove more than one third of the grass blade if possible this helps reduce the risk of disease and pest damage as well as thatch buildup dont be afraid to grasscycle that is mulching your clippings directly back into your lawn rather than bagging them youll be returning up to one third of the needed nitrogen of your turf thereby reducing the amount of additional fertilizer required you also wont be increasing the risk of thatch if you are cutting one third or less of the grass blade each time you mow just be sure that you are not leaving behind visible clumps of grass clippings as this will potentially damage your lawn in this event a second pass with the mower should eliminate any turf residue consider changing the pattern of your cuts each time if you cut north and south one time try cutting east and west the next continuous cutting in the same direction can eventually result in unnecessary soil compaction due to the weight of the mower over repeated mowings disease many of us have already and will continue to battle turf diseases in our lawns this summer brown patch the most common turf disease to georgia lawns will certainly be prominent this season its identified by circular patterns of brownish grass ranging in size from several inches to several feet the conditions for brown patch to emerge are warm temperatures above 70 degrees and high humidity excessive nitrogen fertilization in spring also tends to increase the occurrence and magnitude of the problem treat this and other fungal turf diseases with a fungicide application at the suggested rate on the product label a granular or liquid spray treatment can be effective in controlling the existing problem however throughout the hotter months you may have to apply multiple treatments every two to three weeks to keep the problem in control and to prevent it from spreading weeds there are many varieties of weeds that begin appearing as the temperatures heat up and to many the biggest thug of lawn weeds in the summer is crabgrass a spring application of preemergent works well in treating this and other summer annuals weeds however if you missed that spring treatment you can still treat crabgrass and other weeds with a postemergent weed control these products are targeted to kill weeds after they germinate however be sure to read the label some weed killers are effective on broadleaf weeds only like spotted spurge and dichondra others treat grassy weeds only such as crabgrass and goosegrass so know what youre buying and what youre trying to control also be careful when you apply these products some will burn your turf if applied when temperatures are too high again reading the label entirely will save a lot of potential aggravation fertilization fescue lawns should not be fertilized after may and not again until fall however warm season grasses bermuda zoysia and st augustine should receive a june and august application according to your soil test report you did do one in the spring didnt you bermuda and st augustine can also receive a july fertilization centipede lawns should get their only summer application in july the only other time to fertilize centipede is may hence the nickname lazy mans grass sodding sprigging and aerating the best time of year to sod sprig or aerate a lawn is in the season of active growth for warm season grasses that would be now for fescue the cool season grass spring or fall is the ideal time to aerate or lay sod about joe lampljoe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
good sanitation is the key to controlling camellia petal blight it is not unusual for a camellia shrub to produce more flowers than it can open consequently many buds fail to mature and fall to the grown other flowers that make it to full bloom are often brown or show signs of cold damage however buds damaged by cold weather usually only show browning around the petal edges another cause of unsightly buds and blooms is far more serious camellia petal blight is a fungal disease that can move quickly youll know a plant is infected by this if there is browning around the edge of the flower that quickly moves to the center usually within 24 hours the entire flower will become brown and leathery and will fall from the plant a hallmark sign of this disease is dark brown veins within the lighter brown petal it is most common when conditions have been mild during bloom and humidity has been high due to frequent rain showers once a plant is infected with this disease it is difficult to control the best bet is to remove and destroy all leaves buds and petals from that have fallen to the ground be sure to follow up with a fresh layer of mulch 23 inches thick this helps create a barrier that will inhibit the spread of the spores that cause the fungus the fungus that causes the petal blight persists in the soil so it is important that you repeat this process every year in early spring as an added measure of control a fungicide soil drench and foliar sprays can be used but only when in addition to the sanitation measures listed above when applying the soil drench be sure to soak the entire fall line and beyond this can be 10 feet or more in some cases start applying the drench several weeks before the buds begin to open and repeat the process every three weeks until all buds have fallen fortunately the blight only attacks the flowers so it is not necessary to treat beyond the removal of the last debris however you should repeat these control methods for five years to ensure the problem has been eliminated joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
slime mold looks more noxious than it is things are not always as bad as they seem so is the case with slime mold in this example embedded within a stand of silver dragon liriope as nasty as it looks slime mold is rarely a problem slime molds are commonly found on ornamental plantings lawns mulches and just about anywhere in the home landscape they are most often observed during warm wet conditions they can appear in a multitude of colors as well including white yellow orange red brown or any shade in between as bad as slime mold looks it is harmless to plants and turf the mold feeds on bacteria fungus and decaying organic material the most damage you may see is a slight yellowing of the leaf or blade area due to the mold blocking the surface from getting light no treatment is necessary if the unsightliness is bothersome then rake out the mold or spray it off with a stiff stream of water however it will usually turn black and disintegrate on its own within a few days joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
following a few simple guidelines will help reduce problems in your garden as they say an ounce of preventionyou know the rest but it is true in gardens there are certain problems that are beyond our control when it comes to plant diseases however there are more ways than you may realize to prevent or at least reduce the chance of diseases affecting your plants plant diseases can be bacterial fungal or viral all can enter your garden through a number of different ways and many times it can be difficult to diagnose what the disease might be if it even is a disease many symptoms appear similar from viral to bacterial to fungal even insect damage and cultural practices can show similar signs first create the best growing environment you can for your plants this includes putting the right plants in the right place the soil should be loamy and well amended with plenty of organic matter namely compost a healthy vigorous plant is better able to resist infection if location location location is the key to the best real estate than sanitation sanitation sanitation is the key to a healthy garden start with keeping any new diseased plants out of your garden you do this buy inspecting all plants you are considering for purchase to be sure you dont see any obvious signs or problems or buy certified diseasefree plants whenever possible next buy plants that are resistant to various diseases this is common with hybrid vegetable plants for example so if you like the choices this is a good option always keep your garden free of weeds besides the obvious fact of being unsightly weeds provide haven for certain pests which are disease carriers once they begin feeding on other plants in your garden they can spread disease to them as well this goes for general plant debris as well this should be removed as soon as possible so as not to provide habitats for pests or other plant diseases that finds rotting debris to be a hospitable host if you suspect this debris to already be diseased you should not add this to the compost pile rather this should be removed from the garden and disposed of elsewhere adding diseased plant material to your compost pile can potentially survive the composting process only to emerge again within finished compost people and tools commonly spread disease from plant to plant keep tools like pruners disinfected a simple solution of 10 bleach with 90 water is an effective remedy spray your tools often especially pruners and always after making a cut to a diseased plant avoid working around plants when the foliage is wet many plant diseases are spread through water and for this reason mulch your plants whenever possible mulch provides several benefits one is to provide a protective barrier between the soil and foliage many plants fall victim to soil born diseases caused when water splashes up from the soil onto the foliage mulch is an effective tool in reducing soil related diseases when it comes to watering there are a few important rules to remember avoid wetting the foliage and water early in the morning if possible watering early in the day gives the foliage a chance to dry out by midday the longer foliage stays wet the greater the chances of disease taking hold better yet use drip irrigation as a way to minimize the risk of water transferring disease onto your plants from the soil finally provide good air circulation between plants air movement keeps some diseases from sticking around long enough to take hold and allows plants to dry out more quickly in spite of our best efforts gardens will still get diseases there is no way to prevent them all however if youll apply the above practices you will greatly reduce the amount of problems youll encounter about joe lampljoe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
leafhoppers are the most common source of aster yellows an email arrived recently with several accompanying pictures it was a simple question can you describe what my echinacea purple coneflower is up to and how to prevent it in the future the pictures documented a classic display of the symptoms of aster yellows purple coneflowers display some of the most dramatic evidence of this nonfatal but potentially prolific disease secondary flower heads emerging from primary flowers can be a common sight however aster yellows is a disease that affects over 300 species of plants including herbaceous ornamentals vegetables and even weeds infected plants can serve as the starting place for the spread to other noninfected plants the source of the problem is a bacterialike microscopic organism known as a phytoplasma a tiny insect known as a leafhopper most commonly spreads it as the leafhopper feeds on infected plants it is taking in this phytoplasma through the plant sap once inside the insects body the disease organisms multiply rapidly eventually the phytoplasma is then reintroduced as the leafhopper feeds on healthy plants symptoms of aster yellows develop most quickly and are more severe when temperatures are warm in cooler temperatures plants may be infected without any visible indication unique symptoms also vary between plant types symptoms common to most infected plants include yellow foliage stunted growth flowers that remain on the green side and an overall distorted look controlling aster yellows is challenging there is no known cure for the disease and chemical control of the vectoring leafhopper is usually not effective and therefore not recommended the best means of control for this problem as well as many other garden diseases is good sanitation remove and destroy any infected plants you see immediately this includes all weeds since they can be a common host source for this disease lastly not all plants are susceptible to the disease most woody shrubs seem to avoid the problem as well as a few herbaceous plants such as salvia geraniums and impatiens choosing resistant plants and removal of infected plants are the best control methods for controlling aster yellows in the home landscape joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
avoid prolonged dampness on plant leaves to avoid disease problems disease control can be a challenge in any garden it helps to have a general understanding of them and how they can best be prevented the primary types of plant diseases are viral bacterial and fungal viruses usually occur on new growth bacterial or fungal infections usually occur on older leaves some symptoms are stunted growth spots on leaves rotten fruit or wilting all three diseases are more active during times of high humidity or light steady rain plant foliage never completely dries during these periods this creates a perfect environment for disease to take hold nematodes are also included in the disease group these very small wormlike creatures feed on roots they can stunt growth and cause extensive damage if not controlled however there are many different types of nematodes some of which are actually beneficial to help thwart diseases keep your plants healthy a healthy plant is naturally diseaseresistant fertilize and water regularly but avoid getting water directly on the leaves soaker hoses are an ideal way to help keep foliage dry while watering also you may want to consider growing diseaseresistant varieties all gardeners know that mulch helps conserve water and keeps roots cooler but be sure to use clean mulch do not reuse mulch from season to season as diseases as well as pests can winterover also do not compost any diseased plants as you are likely to recycle the disease right back into your garden in addition to using clean mulch keep your garden clean promptly remove dead or dying plants its also a good idea to thin any thick foliage so that your plants receive adequate air circulation trellis as many crops as you can keeping fruit and vegetation off the ground helps prevent rot and keeps plants dry rotate your crops it is a good idea to plant vegetables in the same family in a different location each season for example avoid planting nightshades such as tomatoes in the same bed that potatoes were recently grown this helps break the reproductive cycle of the disease and helps prevent the depletion of nutrients in the soil another way to keep plants healthy is to make sure your soil has good drainage soggy soil will cause root rot and will allow diseases to flourish an excellent way to create good drainage is to grow your vegetables in raised beds and to use organic amendments such as manure or compost nematode populations can be discouraged by keeping your soil rich in organic matter once a fungal bacterial or viral infection appears it can be treated organically with copper or sulfurbased compounds regular applications are critical to successful control sometimes it helps to be proactive i live in the humid south where diseases can set in overnight and run quickly through the garden to keep tough diseases such as bean rust under control i start spraying with a copperbased compound early in the season before the rust appears all in all the very best way to control plant diseases is by being attentive while it is not practical to expect a totally diseasefree garden you can keep problems to a minimum by following these tips ann myers joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
misuse of deicers can cause excessive build up of salts in the soil much like synthetic fertilizers sometimes its not an easy choice between our safety and the safety of our plants and soil if i lived alone id give the nod to the latter but i must be prudent to protect my family and guests from winter perils namely an icy slick sidewalk or driveway if you live in an area where this can be a problem you know that deicers are a common way to eliminate it but too often we dont use deicers properly their job is to loosen ice from below making it easier to shovel or plow not remove ice completely so why would i discuss deicers in a gardening article because improper or over use of deicers is detrimental to plant life and the environment most deicers are chemicals containing high concentrations of salt excess salts build up in the soil just as with the overuse of chemical fertilizers they impede the uptake of moisture and nutrients others cause leaching of heavy metals which eventually make their way to water supplies although you may not see the damage to plants under a blanket of snow you will by spring symptoms include stunted growth wilting desiccation and burned leaf tips or margins it can also cause permanent root damage the following list includes some of the most common ingredients used to battle ice and snow each winter sodium chloride commonly known as rock salt may be the product we are most familiar with since it has been the most often used deicer since the 1940s millions of tons are used yearly on roads in the united states and canada calcium chloride is produced in flakes pellets and as a liquid it is sometimes sprayed over rock salt to lower its melting temperature which further increases plant and soil exposure to salt damage even though it is considered to be practically nontoxic to aquatic life it does increase algae growth which poses a problem for our waterways potassium chloride occurs naturally in the mineral form of sylvite and can also be extracted from salt water ok thats a cluemore salt it is also used as a fertilizer muriate of potash and as a salt substitute these chloride salts although common choices present their own set of problems as a group they are corrosive to metal and concrete damaging to plant material a harmful skin irritant and potentially lethal to pets please be sure to read the label before purchasing some people broadcast common household fertilizer like 101010 onto the ice thinking they are feeding their plants and lawn while providing a more benign solution its not synthetic fertilizer can have a lot of salt plus nitrogen and phosphorus excessive runoff of these materials is capable of harming our lakes and streams ecofriendly alternatives covering key areas with plastic before a storm and removing it before it has a chance to freeze in place is a good preventative measure that is certainly a more environmentally sensitive option spreading sand or gravel over slick spots will not melt the ice or snow but offers some traction considering that pets are a part of the equation too the choice to opt for saltfree alternatives provides for their safety as well salt buildup from deicers accumulates on an animals paws and coat causing mild to fatal illnesses as they attempt to lick themselves clean one alternative saltfree deicer i found during my research is guaranteed not to be harmful to humans pets or the environment it is trademarked under the name of safe paw another option being tested is calcium magnesium acetate cma made from dolomitic limestone and acetic acid which we know as vinegar this saltfree melting agent is being studied as a substitute in environmentally sensitive areas although it is expensive so far research has shown that it is noncorrosive and there is little impact on plants or animals so while it may be necessary to use melting agents at times it doesnt seem to me we should risk harming our pets soil or the water supply in the process of melting a small amount of it any more than we have to finding saltfree and more pet and ecofriendly alternatives is a good choice joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
place a birdbath where birds can easily escape to cover ever wonder where wildlife goes to get the water they depend on for survival natural water supplies are of course the obvious first choice but in the face of increasing drought and shrinking sources that option is not as easy to come by anymore almost all wildlife can be found within a couple of miles of a water source but as limited sources dry up animals can be reluctant to leave their only known supply rather than searching out for new sources they stay put and in many cases die of dehydration at home we may not be faced with the harsh realities of natures survival of the fittest but water shortages are still a reality and so are suburban and urban wildlife birds are the obvious consideration provide a watering spot for them to enjoy and you will no doubt take pleasure from it as well even a simple birdbath can attract a number of birds just in the first few hours after you fill it i have enjoyed many hours watching the birds splash and groom themselves in the small pool outside my office window i like knowing the water ive placed for them is a safe and essential respite for my feathered friends if attracting birds to your backyard habitat is important to you here are a few things to know will make the experience more enjoyable for you and the birds provide shallow water that birds can easily drink from and bathe in envision birds splashing in puddles after a rain birdbaths are the obvious choice but even a shallow ledge just a few inches deep in a water garden or a shallow stream serve the purpose this way you may attract varieties of birds that need a groundlevel water source other birds such as those that visit a feeder like chickadees finches and cardinals often feel safer from a loftier position of two to three feet especially if there are hiding places for the enemies that prey on them the additional height gives birds an advantage because its harder for them to take to the air when theyre wet but a fancy water feature is not necessary the most basic concrete birdbath on a pedestal works great to draw those birds with preferences for a water source at greater altitudes a flat rock placed just in the center of a bird bath can create a welcomed island of safety for birds as they survey their surroundings from a slightly more secure position a flat stone placed just so its top is at the water level is an ideal height the sound of running or dripping water is irresistible to birds and providing it will afford you the best chance of attracting their attention specially made drippers can be attached to the side of birdbaths or water features if you cant supply the sound in any other way there also exist misters that spray a fine mist on plant leaves for birds that bathe by rubbing themselves against wet leaves such as hummingbirds or warblers but dont worry they use far less water than sprinklers although they work in much the same way included in the array of bird attracting accessories are battery operated wigglers which keep the water in constant motion these not only help keep the water from becoming stagnant but the agitating action acts as a mosquito deterrent as well ponds are a big attraction water features on a somewhat larger scale such as a small pond or waterfall are magnets for attracting various other forms of wildlife within weeks youll likely find raccoons turtles toads frogs hawks owls herons butterflies dragonflies and of course more birds creating a fascinating miniwater ecosystem and dont forget that once frozen these water sources might as well be dried up in areas of the country where the water freezes look for bird bath heaters and deicers no matter what time of year a fresh water supply is necessary and appreciated joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
determine your tolerance for some damage before reaching for control methods integrated pest management ipm is an approach to pest control that uses a combination of treatments starting with the least toxic steps first by identifying a pest and understanding its life cycle and habits nonchemical preventative strategies can effectively be used in the initial stages with good results to me ipm is simply a matter of being in touch with your garden i call it proactive vs reactive gardening its taking an early morning stroll with your cup of coffee simply to observe the daytoday changes by utilizing any opportunity to tune in to whats happening even if its a casual glance as you race to the car your dynamic garden will rarely surprise you when ipm practices are employed the positive results are many healthier plants little to no application of potentially toxic chemicals along with the ensuing runoff higher survival rates for beneficial insects including pollinators and better longterm control of pest populations to start its important to understand that ipm considers that a certain amount of pest damage is acceptable and it is up to the individual gardener to determine the level consequently a more extreme approach to treatment will not take place until this threshold of tolerance has been crossed in many ways ipm appears similar to organic gardening the biggest difference is that with ipm synthetic pesticides are an acceptable method of treatment in the final step steps to ipm the first step is to scout for the presence of developing populations of pests note the location concentrations and make note of changes from day to day next proper identification is important by knowing what you are facing and understand their life cycle and behavioral patterns is an important part of ipm it allows you to determine if action is necessary at this time and provides an opportunity to use the most benign treatment method first that may simply involve hand removal or using only a spray of water third monitor and evaluate ask yourself the following questions is the pest population isolated to a small area or certain crop or are they increasing is the damage getting worse is the damage within an acceptable tolerance level are there any beneficial insect populations currently in this phase you will then determine your acceptable threshold level and decide if more aggressive treatment measures are in order in the forth step control measures are implemented before resulting to synthetic pesticides or herbicides more benign methods should be applied first by maintaining a proactive role in monitoring your garden and landscape more aggressive treatment options are rarely necessary the final step is to evaluate your results based on your methods of treatment did your ipm strategies work what went well and what didnt ipm is not an instant fix but it is an effective one faced with the same scenario in the future what would you do the same and what would you do differently ipm options for preventing and controlling pest problems cultural plant the right plant in the right location and use varieties that do well in your growing area create an inhospitable environment for pests dont give pests a reason to stick around crop rotation is a good example of this by removing their food source from one season to the next sanitation keeping your garden free of debris and diseased plant material will help keep plant diseases at bay diseasefree plants are tougher and better able to resist and withstand damage which could be inflicted by certain pests physical this includes creating barriers to prevent pests from getting to your plants row covers are an example another would be the use of collars around the stems of tender seedlings to protect from cutworms biological beneficial insects such as lady beetles lacewings and praying mantis often come to mind as natural predators in the garden other less often considered or familiar controls for the home gardener include the use of predatory parasites chemical these control options are the last line of defense in dealing with pests in an ipm environment and can do as much harm by nonselectively killing beneficial insects as well chemicals at this phase can include less toxic horticultural oils and insecticidal soaps botanical ie pyrethrins rotenone neem inorganic pesticides such as lime sulfur and finally conventional synthetic pesticides which act as direct toxins with ipm results will improve over time as you learn appropriate control techniques for your garden by applying all the steps of ipm in order the outcome will be a healthier garden with less time and money spent by you dealing with pests joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
synthetic fertilizers may be fastacting but they come with a price so its finally cool for mainstream america to go green organic environmentally friendly products are showing up everywhere from what we put in our gardens to the clothes we wear on our back some organic choices require very little thought such as selecting organic carrots for example we know they were grown without harmful chemicals but what does the farmer or you as a gardener select to fertilize and grow food organically admit it now that youve decided to grow green youre as confused as the next guy when it comes to actually knowing what fertilizer to buy the list of questions builds as you stand in front of the organic gardening section blankly staring at the increasing choices of bagged and bottled fertilizer before you give up unsure of what to make of it all allow me to explain some of the differences between natural organic fertilizers and synthetic nonorganic choices review a few fertilizer basics and then offer some viable organic alternatives to nonorganic products organic vs nonorganic choices all plants receive their nutrients in chemical form they cannot distinguish between how the nutrient was derived whether organic or nonorganic for example when referring to plant nutrition organic or natural generally refers to any fertilizer which is derived from plant animal or mineral origin it must have one or more essential nutrients for plant growth nonorganic fertilizers also known as synthetic are manufactured chemically they are made to deliver nutrients rapidly such as those that are watersoluble or over time as a controlled release although very effective for providing rapid or prolonged periods of feeding these have a high salt index the potential risk to plants and the soil food web is burning and dehydration with the leeching of unabsorbed chemicals into waterways organic nutrients on the other hand must first be broken down and digested by soil microorganisms which then release these nutrients in a form available to plants this process also produces humus a vital ingredient to improving soil structure as part of this structure organically derived nutrients are very resistant to leeching and contain a very low salt index the net result is nutrients that remain in the soil until utilized by plants and little risk of burning or dehydration even in periods of extreme drought or over application fertilizer basics look at any fertilizer package and youll find three numbers prominently listed these are the primary nutrients that are needed in the greatest quantity by the plants these numbers represent the percentage of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium found in each package nitrogen is primarily responsible for vigorous growth and dark green color phosphorus plays a major role in the root development and flowering potassium is mainly responsible for disease resistance and the overall hardiness of the plant based on what you are trying to achieve for your plants growing success will usually determine which fertilizer to buy that decision is based on the numbers referred to above when in doubt a good choice is to select a balanced product one with an equal percentage of all primary nutrients such as 101010 another environmentally friendly fertilizing option is a slow release natural product like milorganite which releases nutrients slowly to the plant 810 weeks and adds organic matter to feed the soil organic alternatives synthetic fertilizers are usually listed simply by their numbers like 101010 above since they are manufactured chemicals organic alternatives however are often listed primarily by what they actually are such as blood or bone meal but somewhere on that package youll find those all important three numbers which is the key to knowing what role that product will play in your garden here is a partial listing of the most commonly available organic fertilizers sorted by their role for providing nitrogen phosphorus or potassium nitrogen dried blood blood meal cottonseed meal fish emulsion and seaweed extract phosphorus bone meal rock phosphate potassium greensand sulfate of potash in addition to the three primary nutrients listed above there are 12 other elements considered essential for plant growth that are absorbed from the surrounding soil organic soil amendments are a readily available way to provide all of these elements as well i rely on these natural amendments to ensure im feeding the soil which in turn feeds the plants i find that to be a safe effective and

half of our outdoor water use is lost to evaporation and runoff in referring to my book title the green gardeners guide someone asked me recently arent all gardens green that simple yet serious question stopped me in my tracks little did he realize how well he summarized the incorrect assumption of millions of gardeners out there today allow me to state for the record all gardens are not green in fact according to a recent national gardening association survey only about 5 of gardeners adheres strictly to organic gardening methods the vast majority falls far short of creating a truly ecofriendly garden and landscape unfortunately as we gardeners and weekend warriors create so much beauty the environmental price we pay can be quite costly take water consumption for example about 30 of all consumption goes to outdoor use and about half of that is wasted mostly due to evaporation and runoff in this time of critical water shortages conserving water is more important than ever if we could learn to water during the dew cycle from late at night until the early morning hours utilize automatic timers soaker hoses and drip irrigation wed save significant water in the process and keep our plants healthier by reducing the amount of time foliage stays wet overwatering also contributes greatly to runoff when water moves across our property it takes with it topsoil and a plethora of chemicals from fertilizers to pesticides and herbicides many of these chemicals end up in storm drains and waterways ultimately harming aquatic life and disrupting ecosystems not to mention the health risks to humans on another note maintaining our landscapes with equipment powered by gasoline engines pollutes the air at a rate far greater than you may have imagined according to the epa a standard gasoline powered lawnmower used for an hour pollutes as much as 40 cars on the road for the same amount of time today engineless reel mowers similar to what our grandparents used are lighter and stronger than ever ball bearing wheels and stainless steel blades make cutting the lawn almost fun again alternatively rechargeable and electric mowers and landscaping equipment now rival gasolinepowered models yet offer greener choices while eliminating the need to ever reach for a gasoline can even simple things like using certified mulch in your flower and vegetable beds can make a big difference in greening your garden its possible that the mulch you are using could contain dangerous material such as arsenic from pressure treated wood to know that the mulch and soil you are buying is free this and other chemical risks look for the mulch and soil councils certification seal any bagged product bearing that seal is certified to be free of unacceptable material in my ecofriendly garden theres no other option speaking of unacceptable random spraying with synthetic or even organic nonselective insect controls when only 3 of insects in our gardens are actually considered pests is anything but green in the process we put the other 97 of neutral and beneficial insects at risk similarly about 7 million birds die each year from the residual effects of consuming insects poisoned by backyard pesticides according to dr stephen kress of the national audubon society the better option is a more proactive approach by connecting with and visiting your garden on a regular basis we can prevent a majority of problems before they get out of hand and when control is necessary more benign solutions are often just as effective when caught early finally one of the easiest steps we can take for a greener garden is to simply put the right plant in the right place it sounds simple and it is when a plant is placed in its proper growing environment it is more robust and vigorous without the need for supplemental fertilizer a healthy plant is also naturally more pest and disease resistant the end result is a garden that thrives without the need for extra chemical controls so are all gardens really green not yet but the more we know about how to make them so the sooner we can get there i hope this helps get you a little closer in your own little ecofriendly corner of the world joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
artificial trees arent necessarily the greener choice for the first twenty something years of my life real christmas trees were the only option i ever knew and frankly artificial trees were so depressingly plasticlooking back then im glad it was never an issue in my house i continued with real trees for the next 10 years of my adult life then something happened we bought a house that had a very tall ceiling and screamed for a tree that was nearly as tall but after one year of spending nearly 200 on a 12foot real tree i knew something had to change it didnt take a math wizard to understand how quickly one can go broke paying for 200 trees each year when todays fake trees look so realistic besides now they come prelit assemble in three easy pieces and store in a sturdy cardboard box within two years they pay for themselves and on top of that just think of all the trees id save over the years we did our shopping found an artificial tree we liked and made the investment i felt pretty good about knowing id never have to buy another throwaway tree again and id be doing something good for the environment too then came the move to north carolina and with it a house with no ceiling taller than nine feet that first december were back to square one now living near the land of christmas tree farms galore what do we do this time actually the decision was easy over the previous year i had researched a lot about various aspects of living a more ecofriendly life as i collected research for my upcoming book everything i thought i was doing right for the environment in defense of buying an artificial tree went out the window here are a few of the reasons why as noted in a recent conversation i had with rick dungey public relations manager for the national christmas tree association artificial trees never biodegrade one of the most common reasons for buying an artificial tree is their longevity although artificial trees can last for years eventually they are discarded where they remain in a landfill forever more fake trees are nonbiodegradable so they never break down real trees are good for the garden after the season real trees can be hauled to the back yard as a minihabitat or it can be ground and used as valuable mulch to retain moisture and improve soil conditions but in all cases it is 100 biodegradable artificial trees include potentially harmful material part of what makes artificial trees so sturdy are the components used in their construction pvc plastics are made from petroleum by products heavy metals are used to stabilize the plastics and the metal branches are mined from the earth in california warning labels are even required on artificial trees to alert users of the potential risk of hazardous materialsincluding lead real trees are good for the environment in 2008 45 million new christmas trees were planted in tree farms across america at any moment there are approximately half a billion trees growing for future harvest that otherwise would not be there while growing theyre absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen stabilizing soil and providing habitats for wildlife as trees are harvested new trees are planted to take their place and unlike artificial trees real trees can often be purchased from local farms artificial trees are imported thousands of miles buying local and supporting area businesses doesnt apply to artificial trees most are made in china shipped across the pacific and then travel many more miles to reach their final destination now having pretty much bashed the argument in favor of artificial trees as better for the environment i certainly recognize there are circumstances where they are more appropriate for certain users sometimes an artificial tree is the only chance at having any representation of the real thing and i appreciate and respect that however when the opportunity presents itself for those that do have an option think twice before opting for artificial christmas trees as the greener option because theyre not joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening

a good layer of mulch will make weed control much easier so how do you know if that plant you are looking at in the ground is really a weed pull it up if it comes out easily it wasnt a weed although thats not really the true definition it seems to be the case more often than not so just what is a weed anyway the most widely accepted definition is simply a plant out of place i get many questions about how to control weeds in lawns and gardens organically and selectively honestly that presents a challenge but with a little patience and dedication satisfactory results are achievable first the best defense is a good offense take lawns for example beyond manual methods such as hand pulling once weeds are present organic controls are unavailable to selectively eliminate only the weeds promoting the health and vigor of the lawn is also the best way to starve off shade out and out compete the weeds too but when youre ready to manage weeds with organic controls there are several options the following is a listing of some of the most popular methods using ecofriendly options manual controls handpulling or manual extraction has an element of satisfaction that no other weed control method can offer if you like instant gratification manual extraction is the only way to go its also one of the few ways for selective control although highly satisfying i realize its not always a practical solution to the problem time and ambition are usually the two most important assets to taking on a manual project however hand weeding in any size garden is easiest after a soaking rain the soil is soft and roots easily yield to even the gentlest tug but be aware of one caveat tap rooted weeds must be pulled out in their entirety making sure to get the entire root otherwise any remaining piece will provide sufficient energy for that weed to regenerate a new plant mulch one of the most effective organic weed control techniques available and certainly one of the most environmentally friendly is to provide natural barriers to weed formation a layer of mulch two to four inches thick is a very effective means of preventing most weeds from germinating ive used just about every type of mulch barrier available including traditional bark and straw mulch plastic sheeting and wet newspapers with additional mulch on top of that heres one caveat if you want to know that the bagged mulch you buy is free of potentially harmful contaminates such as arsenic from treated wood be sure each bag has the certification seal of the mulch and soil council for more information go to wwwmulchandsoilcouncilorg sprays and drenches these methods affect plants on contact by burning or desiccating the cell structure of the plant boiling water works well at killing most weeds with one application some weeds especially those with tap roots such as dandelions may need multiple applications acetic acid vinegar works but common household vinegar at 5 concentration is not effective for mature weeds minimum concentrations above 7 are needed to manage tougher weeds and multiple applications may be necessary with taprooted weeds such as thistle use caution when using acetic acid as it can burn skin and eyes on contact approved sources for herbicide use can be found online or at farm supply stores plantbased ingredients such as citric oil clove oil and garlic are nonselective postemergent herbicides also use caution as they will injure or kill all vegetation they come in contact with tougher weeds usually require multiple applications for complete control ready to use products are available through organic gardening supply sources online and in some garden centers granular preemergent corn gluten is a granular cornbased product that is most commonly used as an organic preemergent control in lawns although effective this product takes several seasons to exhibit results as comparable to synthetic options corn gluten also has the added benefit of containing about 10 nitrogen by volume for natural fertilization as well this product is becoming more popular but is not yet widely available in retail garden centers flame weeders are those devices that use the intense heat of a concentrated flame to destroy the cell structure of the plant typically powered by a propane canister these devices are portable and effective simply pass the flame over the weed for several seconds it is not necessary to visibly burn or ignite the weed a few seconds of intense heat is all that is necessary like the other methods listed above because the roots are unaffected the toughest weeds may require multiple applications use extreme caution when working with this tool no matter which methods of weed control you prefer prevention is still the best way to make sure you keep the weeds from spreading next year although they can still come into your yard through other means eliminating weeds on your property before they go to seed will save you many hours of work next year and beyond about joe lampljoe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to

on july 23 2010 harvesting rainwater could take significant pressure off of local municipalities rainwater harvesting is not new it has been used around the world for thousands of years today we hear the term more and more but not in terms of providing potable water for drinking although many people do but as a way to provide an irrigation source for landscaping for instance a roof area of only 1000 square feet can provide approximately 600 gallons of water during a one inch rainfall containment systems like cisterns and rain barrels are becoming popular again as water quantity becomes scarcer and quality becomes more questionable areas known for low rainfall amounts have been using these systems for decades the most basic form of rainwater harvesting is simply collecting the water and distributing it immediately to the plants its no surprise this method is referred to as a simple system rainwater harvesting using a cistern however is classified as a complex system but dont let the name deter you complex systems simply refer to storing the water after it is collected and providing a way to distribute the water later the term catchment is any area from where the water is harvested the amount of water harvested from a catchment depends on its size surface texture slope and rainfall received if your roof is 2000 square feet and your area averages 20 inches of rain per year you can harvest 24000 gallons of water from your roof each year if you have a container large enough to store it runoff is the water that flows off the surface and that could be harvested this is the water we are able to capture and use immediately or at a later date to irrigate our plants and landscapes the conveyance system channels the water from the catchment to the storage tank for example the holding area is the cistern and the conveyance system would be gutters and downspouts cisterns come in all sizes but i am referring to containers larger than rain barrels the storage containers can be placed above or below ground and each have its advantages and disadvantages underground cisterns cost more to install maintain and when it comes to removing the water a pump is the only option the biggest advantage to belowground systems is that these tanks are out of sight often justifying the higher price this may be the only choice in some neighborhoods with restrictive covenants aboveground cisterns have the advantage of usually being cheaper to install and maintain but they are much more obvious and may not be approved in some neighborhoods other factors affecting costs in an aboveground system include the type of catchment and conveyance system the degree of filtration and the distance between the container and the area irrigated costs can run around 1500 the distribution system is how water is channeled or collected once it has been harvested in a belowground system an electric pump connected to a pipe or a garden hose is necessary to transport the water to a spigot or to the irrigation site in a gravityfed system flow varies greatly to optimize the flow rate or pressure especially if using a drip irrigation or soaker hose system a pump will be needed when it comes to maintaining your cistern no matter where its located there are certain initial and ongoing steps that should be conducted to keep your system operating properly  make sure to adequately enclose the unit first for safety and to minimize intrusion by animals or breeding of mosquitoes  maintain a debrisfree conveyance system this would include inspecting gutters and downspouts  filters should be cleaned regularly  periodically flush debris from container bottom  inspect your system after a heavy rain and at the end of the rainy season to if any obvious concerns need to be addressed  look for any occurrences of overflow and determine a plan for addressing the harvesting of this excess water if appropriate rainwater is always a good source for plants its free of salts and other minerals that can harm plants and root growth the harvesting of rainwater can be used in a largescale environment such as schools parks office parks etc but in the home landscape its a relatively easy and inexpensive system to set up and maintain after the initial cost of installation if any all the water collected and used is free not only will you be realizing the savings in real dollars but more importantly youll be conserving and protecting a valuable resource as well about joe lampljoe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series

bis are earthfriendly but also nondiscriminant and may harm fish bees and some animals botanical insecticides commonly referred to as bis are derived from naturally occurring compounds found in plants widely used in the from the 1800s to the 1940s until the introduction of synthetic pesticides they are once again gaining popularity botanicals are environmentally friendly they break down rapidly so there is less chance for any negative longterm effects most can be applied within one day of harvest because of their rapid degradation it may be necessary to reapply them more frequently and to time applications more precisely bis work quickly to stop insects from feeding although death may not be immediate this coupled with rapid breakdown means that bis can be less harmful to beneficial insects there are many types of botanicals available pyrethrum one of the most common is derived from the pyrethrum daisy it can be used for fleas flies and mosquitoes and is often combined with rotenone and ryania or copper for garden use it is toxic to cats bees and fish so apply it judiciously ryania can be used against citrus thrips european corn borers corn ear worms and codling moths however it is very toxic to dogs try other botanicals before resorting to ryania sabadilla is derived from a lily that grows in central and south america  it can control vegetable pests such as caterpillars thrips stink bugs harlequin bugs and squash bugs sabadilla will kill some beneficial insects and since it is highly toxic to bees it should be applied at times when bee activity is low it has also been known to cause severe allergic reactions in some humans rotenone another botanical that comes from south america  is effective against leaffeeders such as aphids and beetles do not use near ponds or streams as it is toxic to fish also of concern is a recent finding that rotenone may be linked to parkinsons disease although research is not conclusive use this product with caution neem extracts have both fungicidal and insecticidal properties it not only repels insects they disrupt the feeding and growth cycle another advantage is that neem can be absorbed by plants so that insects feeding after the initial application will be affected too in addition it can be used to treat blackspot powderly mildew and rust neem has just recently been added to the family of bis and is gaining in popularity because of its multiple uses and low toxicity insecticidal soaps are also included in the botanicals category they are derived from the salts of fatty acids found in plants insecticidal soaps are very effective against softbodied insects such as whiteflies mealybugs and aphids direct contact with the insect must be made in order for it to work most botanicals do not damage plants and are low in toxicity to pets and humans overall bis are better for the environment and are safe if used according to the directions guest author ann myers joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
when looking to fill a gap consider shopping in your own garden i have good news free plants are all around you ready for the taking all you need to do is divide them to divide a plant means to dig it out of the ground and separate the parent plant into smaller sections its not only an economical way to acquire additional plants it can also be necessary to control size or to rejuvenate it armed with the knowledge that many perennials should be divided every few years for health and aesthetics comes in handy when eyeing your neighbors prized daylilies or coveting a fellow gardeners hardtofind hostas convincing them of the advantages of division can often make or break your success in a triumphant hosta heist or other perennial bounty division is necessary for many perennials to grow and look their best otherwise they can become over crowded as the plants grow out from the center above and below ground soil nutrients become depleted and air circulation towards the center is reduced fall is the ideal time for division of most perennials but allow four to six weeks for plants to establish before the ground freezes by now active growth is waning flowering is complete and the plants are settling into dormancy energy sources are diverted from foliage into roots and below ground reserves plants removed from the soil at this time dont have the same demands as other times of year and can adapt more easily to being divided and replanted elsewhere in the spring they should emerge as strong and viable plants a goodsized clump can be sectioned into multiple pieces however it is important to preserve as much root tissue as possible for each division that you will transplant this can be accomplished using several types of tools a sharp knife machete or a flat shovel or spade make quick work of slicing a perennial clump into multiple pieces you can also combine two spading forks placed back to back into the clump to pull the roots apart for larger plants place your new sections into other garden beds or containers as soon as possible one of the biggest enemies to division demise is the failure to replant the separated pieces before they dry out and become unviable place the new section into the soil at the same level it was growing in its original location i prefer to enrich the soil with a small handful of bone meal and a larger portion of compost mix this around the root zone bone meal enriches the soil slowly it contains phosphorus and is good for root stimulation without inducing new shoot or foliage growth compost is always good for improving soil and adding important nutrients to finish the project backfill with the existing soil and water thoroughly to hydrate the roots and eliminate air pockets an important finishing touch is to add several inches of mulch over or around your new divisions mulch helps keep the soil moist temperatures more consistent and reduces the chances of cold weather heaving it is great to know that dividing most perennials is actually good for them not only does it provide an inexpensive and easy way to increase your plant collection but it also helps to keep the plants healthy and looking their best too joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
fall is the best time to assess your garden and plan ahead for spring fall is an exciting time to be in the garden yes it is the end of the current growing season but its the start of next years garden as well but getting the best results next season and beyond begins with steps taken now as we clean up clear out and get ready for spring first it helps to understand why the clean up process is so important many pests and diseases will over winter in plant debris if theyre given the opportunity removing these habitats improves our chance of eliminating numerous future problems so a fall garden clean up should include the following activities  cut back perennials cutting off the dead and spent foliage a few inches above the ground in the fall will not harm the plant  remove spent annuals and seasonal vegetables unlike perennials annuals do not come back from season to season so there is no reason to leave these in the ground pull them up roots and all and add them to your compost pile  remove weeds and leaf debris these are common places for diseases and pests to over winter  compost only the healthy material as you remove debris from you fall cleanup projects be sure to add only the pestfree and nondiseased plants to your compost destroy any diseased plant material or remove it from you garden pathogens and insect pests can winterover and return next year in a compost pile that doesnt get hot enough  take pictures and make notes document what was growing in your beds this is especially helpful for perennials that will be cut back for the season as more plants are added having a record of what was planted will allow you to avoid injuring dormant perennials notes are also a great way to document what worked and what didnt while it is fresh in your mind this is a great time to gather you thoughts  get a soil test this is a great time to find out important information about your soil most reports include details such as ph level and nutrient analysis knowing this information in the fall is the ideal time to act on any deficiencies or amendments that may be necessary  amend the soil with natural organic materials homemade compost manure blood meal bone meal cottonseed meal greensand etc organic amendments are a great way to improve the long term health of your soil by adding them in the fall they have time to break down into a form that plants can use in time for spring organic material is an easy way to achieve all the desirable qualities of healthy productive soil in an environmentally safe way  plant for next season fall is also the very best time to plant trees shrubs perennials winter annuals bulbs and cool season vegetables the soil is warm and the air is cool so less energy is required of the plant overall the warmer soil will allow roots to become established and give the plants a better chance of looking their best this list is should get you started on practical steps you can take to having your best garden yet joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
roots are a good indication of the health of a plant spring fever will strike at any moment are you ready for it you can be if you follow a few simple guidelines as you head out to the nursery for that next big purchase bringing home healthy disease free plants will make your garden look better and make your gardening experience more enjoyable most plant buyers cannot overcome the urge to purchase plants that are in full bloom in the nursery who can resist the temptation to bring home the most beautiful plants you and me i hope plants already in bloom require a lot of energy to sustain those blooms next time choose plants that have flower buds but are not yet in bloom this way you can get the plants in the ground and allow time for the roots to establish a bit first even better pinch off the flower blooms completely when you plant theyll come back and the roots will receive the plants energy resulting in more established plants that look even better first check the roots if it is a woody ornamental tree or shrub dont be afraid to pull it from its container healthy plants will have roots that are light in color they will appear evenly distributed without looking crammed stay clear of plants that have dark roots or ones that have roots that spiral around the inside of the container these plants are pot bound and may have a difficult time establishing in the landscape inspect each plant for signs of pests as many hide on the underside of the leaves look closely as you might miss them at first glance you might have a clue of their presence if you see leaf stippling small black flecks or a sticky residue especially on the underside avoid purchasing plants that appear to be leggy or stretched these plants have been growing in light that was insufficient for their needs although they may recover they have been stressed your goal for a great looking plant long term is to purchase plants that have not been under any apparent stress foliage that is abnormally light may be a good indication that the plant was over or under watered these extremes exhibit similar symptoms either case is undesirable and adds additional stress to the plant another good way to reduce plant damage caused by diseases is to purchase plant varieties that are disease resistant this does not ensure that plants will be immune from any particular disease but it does indicate that the plant displays characteristics which minimize the impact of a certain disease these plants have a genetic ability to resist significant damage to a certain disease or pathogen be sure to recognize that resistant doesnt mean immune what qualifies the plant to be considered resistant is the relatively small degree of impact that a certain pathogen has on that particular plant variety the best way to know if you are buying a disease resistant variety is to do your homework the internet books newsletters magazines and your county extension service are all good sources your local county extension service is also a great source for information and is specific to your area and zone the best way to keep unhealthy plants out of your garden is to leave your emotions at home next time you head for the garden center apply tough love when shopping for plants in the long run youll be glad you did joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
we frequently hear the terms annuals and perennials in reference to gardening and particularly flower gardening these terms refer to the lifespan of the plant annuals complete their entire lifecycle in one growing season and then die perennials on the other hand given the right conditions will continue to survive for two or more growing seasons if annuals only live for a relatively short period then why do we even bother with them first annuals can provide that perfect punch of color right where you need it they look spectacular in containers and deliver that wow factor in any mass planting when was the last time you saw a corporate office development that didnt have a bed of bright colorful annuals by definition annuals are plants that germinate grow flower set seed and die all in one growing season think marigold or zinnia within this broad category or annuals there are subcategories that further reveal a bit more about the plant these are hardy annuals this is an annual that will reseed and withstand frost the mother plant dies but the seeds overwinter and germinate the next year cleome is an example of a hardy annual halfhardy annuals these are plants that will withstand light frost seeds can be sewn in late summer and these plants will grow bloom and survive some winter weather to continue blooming as the weather warms again in late winter and early spring the classic example of this plant is the pansy tender annual these are most of the annuals we find at garden centers and see in mass plantings in the office parks and subdivisions these plants are easily killed by even light frost and only thrive in the warmer weather of spring summer and early fall again think marigolds zinnias coleus and impatiens there are many more joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
hydrangeas offer a lot of bang for your buck throughout the season walk into a garden with a hydrangea in bloom and your attention will be captured immediately the big bold colorful blooms of hydrangea macrophylla literally bigleaf hydrangea make a statement that cannot be ignored this is the hydrangea that most of us see in our minds when the name comes up its a favorite pot plant of florists and we have all probably given or received one at some time in our lives but it is in the garden that the french hydrangea truly comes into its own confusing bloom forms a garden hydrangea is a woody deciduous shrub measuring 56 feet or more tall by about as wide at maturity its large leaves in shades of medium to dark matte green provide the background to the two different bloom forms 1 mophead or hortensia blooms or 2 lacecap blooms both bloom forms are the same plant if you will with different hair color this is an area of confusion for many people who are not familiar with lacecap blooms yes they were meant to look that way and no the small fertile flowers in the center will never mature to look like their sister the hortensia or mophead their lacey more delicate look adds a different dimension to the garden youll find hydrangeas at your garden center when they begin to come into bloom this is a good time to see what is available and what you personally like but planting hydrangeas in late spring or early summer requires more attention on your part the newly installed plant does not yet have a root system in place to keep up with the demands of all those big leaves and blooms you will need to water frequently during dry periods of the first two growing seasons to allow the plant to develop its mature root system this applies to all newly planted plants not just hydrangeas although blue is popular hydrangeas colors can be altered where to plant a french hydrangea french hydrangeas often appear on lists of shadeloving plants this is not technically correct french hydrangeas need direct sunlight to bloom well at least 46 hours what they dont need is direct afternoon sun particularly in the south direct sun results in increased transpiration or water loss from the leaves hydrangeas planted in the stressful late afternoon sun will appear wilted and in need of water if there is sufficient water in the soil the plant will recover by itself as soon as the sun sets dont water a plant wilted by afternoon sun  too much water can result in root rot problems a hydrangea that is wilted in the morning before the heat of the day definitely needs water  immediately if you have hydrangeas that have not bloomed while planted under trees you may want to consider limbing up the trees to allow more light to hit the hydrangeas  or alternatively moving them to a sunnier location in the fall just before they start to lose their leaves planting and caring for your new hydrangea when you bring your hydrangea home you will need to dig a hole at least twice the size of the pot it is in think about this before you choose between the 2gallon plant and the 5gallon plant a smaller plant will quickly grow to the size of a larger plant and will probably suffer less transplant shock be aware that almost all hydrangeas in nursery pots will have pink blooms due to the lack of aluminum in the potting soil once in the ground their color can change depending upon the ph of the soil  more on this later take the soil from the hole and mix it with the following amendments in this proportion  2 parts native soil  1 part compost or composted cow manure  1 part either finely ground pine bark chips or granite sand or another soil aerator such as an expanded slate chip product editors note new evidence suggests that the planting hole not be amended with additional materials but rather that the native soil be well broken up in theory plant roots would penetrate through the amended hole and into the native soil but in reality they tend to be lazy and the planting hole acts as a container actually causing a potbound situation if soil amendments are required it is best to add them to the entire planting area instead remove your plant from its pot and inspect its roots if the roots have formed a mat or are growing in a circle around the outside of the soil the plant is potbound be ruthless in loosening and cutting away these matted roots you may end up reducing the root ball of the plant considerably dont worry the roots will grow back and will now grow out into the surrounding soil i keep a serrated knife or an old tree saw in my tool basket just for such transplanting situations set the plant in the prepared hole if youve dug too deeply you may have to remove the plant and refill the hole with the amended soil to a point that the crown of the plant is at or slightly above the surrounding soil level remember that adding water will compact the soil below the plant  you may want to plant slightly high to compensate for this before placing the plant back in the hole sprinkle in a handful about  cup of a good balanced three even numbers timedrelease fertilizer that feed the roots for 34 months once your plant is placed begin to refill the hole with the amended soil gently firm the soil as you go until you have the hole well filled finally finish the planting by watering thoroughly that means until air bubbles stop coming to the surface from the surrounding soil this insures that the soil and the roots are in direct contact and avoids losing precious roots to drying out top the soil around the plant with a twoinch layer of a good mulch to help with moisture retention sit back a watch your plant grow dont be impatient for blooms in the first two years on small 1 gallon plants smaller plants are usually putting all their energy into growth in their first two seasons also avoid high nitrogen fertilizers those with a high first number that will only cause rapid green growth not bloom high phosphorus fertilizers a larger second number  sometimes called bloom boosters  are also not helpful for hydrangea bloom production pruning if there is one issue that confuses even experienced gardeners its when or if to prune french hydrangeas in the south think of french hydrangeas the way you would an azalea  prune after blooming this usually means in july  certainly before the first of august the plant will not be hurt by removing up to a third of the growth  the new growth that will appear after pruning contains the bloom buds for the next season avoid any fall pruning  youll only be removing your blooms it may be true that the leafless branches of a hydrangea are not the most attractive part of a winter garden however if they have been planted correctly with a good background of evergreen foliage they are not nearly as distracting if an older plant has been allowed to outgrow its location or has become leggy and bare on the bottom it may need a good renewal pruning renewal pruning means pruning the plant back severely down to 18 or below in either early spring or after bloom you will end up with a stump with few if any leaves but the large mature root system will quickly renew the plant you will sacrifice bloom for that growing season but gain a betterproportioned plant just dont try this in the fall as you can kill your plant one final pruning chore is spring cleanup done as the hydrangea buds begin to emerge examine each plant for older or dead branches and remove them as far back as the ground you may need a pair of loppers for this removing old canes regularly encourages new growth you can test a branch for living tissue by scratching it lightly with a thumbnail or pocketknife  if there is a green layer just beneath the surface its a living branch this is also a good time to nip off any remaining dead blossoms spring startup an established hydrangea needs little care other than the following spring routine  rake out old mulch and leaves  remove old dead canes  apply 12 cup of timedrelease fertilizer within the dripline all around plant  apply a 1 12 to 2 inch layer of compost or composted cow manure as a topdressing over the fertilizer  pluck or snip off any frostdamaged leaves  undamaged leaves will quickly fill in and your plants will look much better other hydrangeas to consider for your garden hydrangeas are the hot new shrub in the nursery trade the recently introduced endless summer macrophylla has sold enormously but there are many other varieties of hydrangea that are more than worth growing in fact becoming a hydrangea collector is quite rewarding in addition to french hydrangeas consider adding varieties of these to your landscape  annabelle hydrangea hydrangea arborescens annabelle  oakleaf hydrangeas hydrangea quercifolia  peegee hydrangeas hydrangea paniculata grandiflora and other paniculata varieties  climbing hydrangeas hydrangea anomala petiolaris more hydrangea information as your interest in hydrangeas grows you may want to invest in a reference book there are two new ones on the market in 2004 that can be very helpful hydrangeas for american gardens by michael a dirr timber press 2004

despite impressions to the contrary there are ecofriendly solutions to rose care over the last several weeks as ive toured several gardens around the country im reminded that in spite of the beauty of roses in a garden they are one of the most feared plants to grow some gardeners try and succeed at growing pristine specimens others attempt and give up and some never try waving the white flag before even getting started its true other than their beauty roses are notorious for two things first they are most famous for their susceptibility to certain diseases namely black spot secondly roses are one of the favorite cuisines of japanese beetles and other chewing sucking pests the beauty of a rose bush can be decimated overnight by a hungry group of beetles in spite of the potential ravages that can be imposed on these plants with diligence and proactive measures pests and diseases can be kept in check however its this required extra attention combined with the perceived need to wage chemical warfare that seems to turn away more gardeners every year good news over the last several years great strides have been made in disease resistance when it comes to shrub roses plant breeder william radler found it overwhelming to keep up with the rituals required to keep his many roses looking healthy so he began the mission of literally breeding the diseases right out of roses in 1988 his mission became a reality when the award winning knock out rose was created since its introduction the knock out rose continues to reinforce its reputation as truly carefree as a prolific bloomer and disease resistant plant it has easily become the best selling new rose on the market simple safe rose care alternatives clearly there is an arsenal of products available to dust and spray roses for every pest and disease known to man but at what cost i am a strong advocate for exercising an increased level of tolerance before ever reaching for a chemical control even then ill go for the most benign options first over my years behind the scenes at countless public and private gardens ive made note of the most effective benign methods ive experienced personally and through interviews with other experts when growing roses to fight pest and diseases the following list includes some of my findings and offers some of the more ecofriendly solutions harpin protein this is relatively new proprietary technology discovered at cornell university it was called a major scientific breakthrough by the usda and awarded the presidential green chemistry award by the epa in nature harpin proteins are produced by bacteria that cause plant diseases although harpin products have no direct effect on pathogens or pests studies show that when plants detect harpin they activate their own natural growth and defense system to protect themselves in addition harpin activates the plants photosynthetic activity making for an overall healthier plant neem oil although not new neem continues to be a front runner as an effective pest and disease control method especially with roses neem is derived from the neem tree native to india for controlling diseases on roses such as black spot and powdery mildew neem has many fans and is a proven preventative and control as an insecticide neem is an effective control at fighting one of roses most notorious pests the japanese beetle neem can act as a repellent it can disrupt the feeding cycle of certain other pests and it can suffocate others neem is available as a concentrate that you mix with water and spray on your plants it is also available as a readytouse spray however some neem rtu sprays include other active ingredients organic or synthetic to increase the killing power for me sticking with the pure neem oil concentrate is the most benign and ecofriendly route it breaks down quickly in the environment and is nontoxic to mammals potassium bicarbonate potassium bicarbonate has been proven effective in over 200 university studies and more than nine years of organic agricultural use at preventing and curing many plant diseases including black spot on roses unlike many other commercial fungicide products potassium bicarbonate is safe to use and is even approved for use by the organic materials review institute omri the formula used at the consumer level is the same used for commercial agriculture it is currently available to the consumer as greencure wwwgreencurenet with ecofriendly options for growing and keeping roses healthier and with less time required then ever before maybe its time for you to think about taking another look at adding them to your garden soon joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
perennials as opposed to annuals come back year after year here is a questions i fielded recently i finally know what a perennial is but now im hearing terms like herbaceous and woody perennials now im starting to get confused again how many kinds are there and whats the difference and here is my answer perennials are classified as either hardy herbaceous semiwoody woody and tender here is a brief explanation of each hardythese perennials will tolerate frost however there are varying degrees of cold a hardy perennial can handle a perennial thats hardy in georgia may not be hardy in wisconsin so be sure perennials you purchase are hardy in your zone herbaceousthese are plants that die back to the ground at the end of the season it does not mean the plant is dead however the foliage above the ground is the roots are not and will put out new growth the following season most garden perennials that we buy are herbaceous semiwoodyalthough not as woody as a shrub these perennials do form a woody base and stems lavender and rosemary would be good examples woodythese are shrubs or trees they dont die after one season assuming theyre planted in the right zone tenderthese are perennials that cant be overwintered outdoors except in tropical or subtropical regions usually these plants are grown as annuals a good example of this would be coleus in florida these plants may grow year round outdoors but would die in colder climates joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
perennials chosen for their foliage combined with annuals can make a striking display when i go to a nursery or garden center what always draws me in is the sea of beautiful flowers calling my name from the parking lot most of what we see from the pavement is the seductive beauty of annuals plants that complete their entire life cycle during one growing season so they go from seed to plant to flower and then to seed again and finally die all in usually just a matter of months the variety of annuals to choose from seems mind boggling and more are coming on the market all the time they are a great addition to the landscape and provide that punch of color right where you need it with the tradeoff of a relatively shortlived display classic examples of annuals include pansies petunias and marigolds a comment i often get regarding annuals is that gardeners get tired of replacing them year after year today there are more and more demands on our time than ever before trends indicate that many of us are seeking ways to spend less of it in the garden while still enjoying the benefit of a colorful landscape the solution often given is to go with flowering perennials in general the flower of the plant is less dramatic and often blooms for only a week or two however these plants persist for more than one season and therefore perform longer in the garden well to this i say its not an eitheror decision go with both perennials are a good longerterm solution to many garden beds providing not only great color but are often selected more for their foliage think hosta and ferns in fact when in bloom perennial flower time can be short lasting just a week or two think tulips or daffodils one trick to getting more color from a perennial display is to arrange beds so that just as one perennial is completing its bloom cycle another is beginning for example daffodils can be purchased as early mid and late season bloomers planting all three types in a bed will provide an extended period of color from the flowers to further illustrate a way to extend the display even longer add daylilies to that same bed then as the last late season daffodils have finished blooming and are in decline with their not so attractive foliage the daylilies are there to fill in literally color from the same bed now continues from early spring through late summer with a similar form the best part is that the display continues the next year and for years to come with no additional work annuals on the other hand can really punctuate a flowerbed or border in a way that perennials have yet to achieve there is every color under the rainbow and bloom times can last for months with the right care so next time youre faced with which flower type is best for you enjoy both each plays an important role in the garden and landscape about joe lampljoe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
wash clothing in hot water and clean tools thoroughly with alcohol to remove the oil rhododendron philodendron toxicodendron ill gladly take the first two but something about that last one sounds a bit ominous dont you think thats because toxicodendron is the plant genus to three of the most hated plants in north america specifically poison ivy oak and sumac nine out of ten of you reading this likely feel the same way that i do about this group collectively referred to as poison ivy we have already suffered multiple allergic reactions during our lifetime and more instances are likely to follow for those of you yet to experience this misery dont gloatyour time may still be coming in fact only one percent of the us population is considered truly immune you cant get the allergic reaction to poison ivy on the first exposure although it may happen on the second encounter most of the time it is years of repeated mild exposure that ultimately leads to that first time outbreak unless you live in hawaii alaska or parts of the desert at least one of these plants grows in your state poison ivy is usually found east of the rockies while poison oak is most common up and down the west coast and southeast poison sumac is common along the eastern states regardless of what you call it these plants pack a powerful punch the active ingredient that leads to days or weeks of itching oozing blisters is urushiol uroo sheol its located in the sap of the plant simply brushing up against an intact plant wont cause a reaction thats the good news the bad news is that the plants are very fragile the slightest abrasion from insects animals or even the wind can release this toxic oil the good news is you must have direct contact with the oil to have an outbreak the bad news is urushiol is a highly persistent oil it can remain potent for years  even on dead plants although avoiding direct contact is a great first defense its not a guarantee that you wont still get it because the oil easily sticks to everything that touches it this high mobility makes even couch potatoes vulnerable if you happen to handle a garden tool a ball or toy or even a pet that has made direct contact with the oil you can get it too ironically most animals including cats and dogs are not allergic to urushiol what to do if you suspect exposure the oil can be removed from your skin if caught in time the earlier you can cleanse the exposed area of urushiol the better chance you have of avoiding an outbreak thats the good news the bad news is urushiol can penetrate the skin in as little as five minutes the sooner you clean the exposed skin the better your chances of avoiding a rash fortunately over the counter solvents are an effective first step at removing the oils they are applied liberally to the affected area in the same way common rubbing alcohol is also effective at stripping the oil when applied to the affected area unfortunately its also very effective at removing your bodys protective layer as well any additional exposure the same day will enable the urushiol to penetrate your skin twice as fast next rinse your body thoroughly with water only then shower with soap and water clothes should be washed immediately in hot water and any tools shoes or equipment should be cleaned as well with rubbing alcohol be careful when handling these items and wear gloves that can be disposed of after use once you get the rash the first signs of an outbreak occur about four to 48 hours after exposure redness of the skin and swelling are the first symptoms then comes the blistering and itching as tempting as it is avoid itching your rash contrary to popular believe although the itching wont spread the rash bacteria beneath the fingernails can lead to infection severe cases that include infection over 30 of the body or rashes on the face or genitals are treated with oral prescription steroids otherwise there are several over the counter products that are designed to relieve itching and dry up the oozing blisters some of the most common readily available aids for treating the symptoms include corticosteroid creams such as hydrocortisone calamine lotion and antihistamines such as benadryl untreated the rash will usually clear up on its own in about two to three weeks eradicating poison ivy the fastest way to eliminate the poison ivy is to pull it out from the roots of course most of you right now are thinking ive lost my mind but no i havent however you will need to wear protective gloves as well as clothing that will cover as much of your skin as possible soak the entire area where the poison ivy is growing with water to make the soil soft use a shovel or fork to turn over the soil and pull out the roots discard the vines and roots in a large plastic garbage bag inevitably there will be some roots left that will resprout hit these new sprouts approximately two weeks after they appear with spray with glyphosate roundup or orthos kleeraway grass  weed killer or triclopyr  orthos brushbgon poison ivy killer mix these products as directed on the label it may take more than one application before the entire plant has died if the ground is just too difficult to work you can cut the vines off at the ground apply the glyphosate or triclopyr at full strength to the cut area again some of the roots may resprout and you should spray them with additional glyphosate or triclopyr as directed if youre highly allergic or just cant imagine getting close enough to actually handle these plants use any of the chemicals listed above and spray the plants several times until they eventually die this is one of the rare exceptions where youll see me suggest the use of chemicals as a first line of offense lastly never burn poison ivy the oils can be carried in the smoke to affect your body and there is the added risk of it being carried into your eyes nasal passages mouth and lungs clearing up some misconceptions scratching the rash does not cause it to spread the urushiol oil that causes the itching is not contained in the fluid of the blister nor does the poison ivy rash spread through the bloodstream it is only active where the oil penetrated the skin poison ivy is not contagious from person to person it is only be spread by direct contact but that may include secondary contact ie petting an animal that has the oil on its coat although the old expression leaves of three leave them be is good advice poison ivy has three leaves poison oak has three to five and sumac has seven to 13 more fun if youd like to read more about my

shearing is a form of deadheading midsummer is often a time in the garden where annual flowerbeds start to look a bit tired that is unless you take the time to deadhead your plants deadheading is the act of removing spent flower blooms from the plant to the new gardener deadheading can seem drastic but the experienced veteran knows that deadheading is vital to prolonging the display of beautiful flowers and to the health of the plant for a number of reasons promotes reblooming the annuals you plant in your garden each year really have only one mission to produce seed during its relatively short life if the plant is successful in this endeavor then it has accomplished what it was born to do upon completion of this mission the plant will start to decline and die by removing flower blooms that have passed their prime you are preventing the plant from accomplishing its sole purpose consequently the plant is signaled to send in reinforcements by way of more flower blooms all with the intent of producing seed deadheading therefore keeps the plant in constant production mode to our delight the outcome is a steady show of new blooms prevents spreading as beautiful as most annuals can be too much of a good thing can be too much annuals reproduce by seed and if given the opportunity you may end up with far more plants next year than you ever wanted however if your desire is to have more of the same next year then allow some of your late season blooms to stay on the plant stronger bushier plant whenever you deadhead you are redirecting the plants energy from producing seed to putting on new growth above and below ground the results above ground will often be the emergence of new shoots from two or more buds rather than the previous one when i buy annuals from the nursery i often will deadhead most of the flower buds this gives the plants more time to establish in the garden and creates a better foundation for seasonlong success garden health anytime i have the opportunity to remove dead or dying plant material including spent flower blooms from the garden i do it i know that by doing so i reduce the chances of promoting pests and disease from taking hold aesthetics an obvious reason for deadheading includes keeping your garden looking its best not only are you removing unsightly brown wilted plant material but by doing so you are setting into motion a rejuvenation process that often creates a better looking plant and one that is far more floriferous midsummer doesnt have to signal the end to peak flower displays a periodic inspection of your flower beds along with some judicious deadheading will be the most important steps you can take to ensuring a spectacular season long display joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
remove the flowers so annuals can put their energy into healthy roots for prolonged bloom the allure of those beautiful annuals calling our name as we drive by the nursery or pull into the home improvement store can be too much we probably didnt even have flowers on our shopping list now im as weak as the next guy when it comes to impulse buying and im an admitted plantaholic but before any new flowers or plants go home to my garden they must pass a tough inspection fortunately for me many happy gardeners buy up all the annuals in full bloom the ones with the most blooms currently on display i on the other hand use these flowers as a guide but proceed to purchase the plants that have yet to bloom or are just starting to bud these are the plants that will look great a few weeks from now in my garden when the others may have already fizzled out it takes a lot of energy to put out flower buds i prefer that energy to go into making a bigger stronger root system first rather than trying to spread plant resources in too many directions now i realize annuals are easy plants to grow and theyre usually very productive for the few weeks or months that they are on display but unless i need color impact today ill opt for disbudding an annual in full bloom or look for ones yet to flower be sure to check underneath the leaves for pests or diseases next i check for pest damage i usually have enough pests in my garden already and the last thing i want to do is bring more home be sure to look all around the plants especially under the leaves where most pests like to hide look for signs of discolored leaves or ones that look like theyve been chewed on or have holes these plants are likely hosts for any number of pests bring these plants home and youve just unwittingly invited a whole host of other problems as i inspect the leaves im also looking for disease problems again a discolored or spotted leaf is a good sign of problems it may be that the plant has simply had too little or too much water or light however disease symptoms can show the same signs assuming i have a choice of which plants im buying and i usually do the plants that show stress dont come home with me although it may be a very correctable problem why take the chance when choices abound the next inspection point comes with the general form of the plant is it short and stocky full looking or is it tall and leggy kind of gangly i want the compact plant this one matured under the best conditions and id rather not take the time to rehabilitate a plant that has suffered these may continue to do so in my garden the plant on the left has been in the pot too long and is root bound lastly how do the roots look are they fully developed without being root bound root bound plants can become stunted and without some help from you at planting time may never break the cycle the plant will simply languish at best this sounds like a tough regime for little annuals to pass the test and i admit most of these problems are correctable with a little knowledge but i say if youre spending good money then being a bit more selective at the point of purchase will pay big dividends in your garden joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
butterflies have specific needs that can be easily incorporated into any garden in the warm summer months its easy to tell the gardens that are the serious butterfly attractors where butterflies abound its usually not by chance theyre attracted by specific elements all which can easily be added to any garden butterflies need nectar throughout their life but adults feed primarily in sunny areas they are most attracted to brightly colored flowers in hues of red orange yellow purple and pink for this food source flowers with flat tops make good landing pads and short flower tubes make easier access to nectar good tried and true examples of sunloving favorite flowers include zinnia verbena blackeyed susan purple coneflower butterfly bush and lantana to create an even more inviting environment provide a water source in the form of a shallow mud puddle or muddle a saucer from a flowerpot or any shallow container works well a flat rock placed within the saucer provides a convenient spot for butterflies to land and rest as they take up water minerals and nutrients muddles are easy to make in addition to the container and stone add some sand mushroom compost and water to create a slurry mix butterflies also need to warm their wings before taking flight to accommodate them flat stones are good for absorbing heat they can be located in the garden as a great place for butterflies to rest and bask in the suns rays before their busy day begins this dill plant attracted dozens of future butterflies attracting butterflies is only half the pleasure encourage them to stay and lay eggs for a future generation include in the garden or landscape host specific plants that serve as food for the butterfly larvae butterflies will almost always lay their eggs on plants preferred by that caterpillar however its important to do your research and know what host plants are preferred by that caterpillar larva they usually have a strong preference to just a few specific plants some popular host plant choices include parsley dill fennel queen annes lace passion vine ilkweed and many grasses just keep in mind as the caterpillar matures it will be munching on the host plant as its food source be sure to be aware of this and not confuse the damage as a problem caused by an undesirable pest therefore avoid the use of any insecticides or pesticides as these will likely kill the larvae and butterflies within a few weeks a chrysalis will form and the larvae will develop into the next generation of butterflies to not only adorn your garden but perform important pollinating duties as well although there are more than 700 species of butterflies in north america ranging in size from barely a halfinch to nearly 10 inches most have a short life span averaging only 1020 days the more we can do to attract and keep them in our gardens the more enjoyment well have from these beautiful creatures joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
read the tag it contains valuable information about the preferred conditions for your plant wasnt it anita bryant who said a day without orange juice is like a day without sunshine is anyone else old enough to remember that one well this is the way i feel about perennials in the garden you just have to have them perennials play such a versatile role in rounding out a garden design or landscape perennial plants and flowers come in virtually every shape size color and texture as you observe the natural landscape these combinations come into play without you even realizing it as we plan our gardens perennials are the plants of choice to fill in those lower and mid layers with whatever form color and texture desired they are what ties gardens together in a pattern of rhythm balance and even punctuation as you work with perennials in landscape or garden design keep in mind a few important guidelines to ensure a great looking and vibrant long lasting garden right plant right place first know what growing conditions you have for the area you want to plant a perennial requiring full sun and welldrained soil will languish in a shady or boggy site so plan accordingly conversely a plant that prefers shade will appear washed out and stunted when grown in full sun next pick plants that are suitable to your climate a perennial thats hardy in zone 7 may die in zone 5 so do your homework first and make sure the plants you like are suited for your region or even microclimate if youre unsure call your county extension service they will be happy to assist you with appropriate choices and varieties for your climate use layers to showcase plants as you lay out your garden plan for the tallest plants and flowers to go toward the back of the border or center of the bed assuming you have access around the bed then plant out from there layering down so that the shortest plants are in the front the best landscape designs use this technique it allows the garden to appear full while showing off as many plants as possible its not all about the flower although perennials are beautiful when in flower and can make for a stunning display the blooms last only a couple of weeks in many cases so plan your design around form texture and color of the foliage the best looking designs incorporate diversity and this is where form and texture really come into play think of it like this when perennials are in full bloom who notices the foliage however for the 80 of the time that we see the plants not in bloom all we see is foliage try placing large thick foliage plants like hosta just behind the finer smaller foliage of astilbe or juniper or try a tall spiky fern fronted by the dark green glossy foliage of a wild ginger you get the idea its fun to experiment with different combinations to incorporate all three design elements youll be a better gardener for it so next time you head to the garden center to plan your perennial garden think beyond the flower and focus on the plant combinations that work well together when not in bloom youll have a garden that looks great even after the flowers fade joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
lilies are far more tolerant than their fussy reputation youve eaten all the eggs and chocolate bunnies you can handle and the only thing left is that easter lily you received as a gift you begin to wonder now what do i do after blooming easter lilies lilium longiflorum can be planted directly in your garden in full sun or partial shade and will bloom again in late summer of the following year if these lilies inspire you there are a number of other lily types you might like to try and while the best time to plant lilies is in the fall they can also be planted in the spring easy to grow asiatic and oriental lilies are two options that should be hardy to zone 8 asiatic lilies bloom in spring and early summer while the sweetly fragranced orientals bloom in the summer the single most important factor for success with lilies is proper drainage lilies prefer a ph of 65 to 70 and soil rich in organic matter apply a balanced fertilizer 101010 in the spring just as the spears show and avoid overfertilization as it creates tender growth and susceptibility to diseases pass from plant to plant by aphids if planting your lilies from a pot make sure the soil level of the pot is at the same depth as your garden soil tease the fragile roots gently outward if they appear to be pot bound water thoroughly and apply a 23 layer of mulch dont let the mulch contact the stems directly another option is to plant lilies among lower growing plants or shrubs lilies prefer their feet in the shade and their head in the sun planting bulbs is easy too select firm bulbs in packages from a garden center or company you trust avoid purchasing loose bulbs from a bin as lily bulbs do not have protective skins and tend to dry out and bruise easily in this environment as a rule of thumb plant lilies at a depth equal to 34 times their height as this allows for the formation of stem roots in addition to bulb roots which will feed the plant during the growing season after flowering cut no more than 13 of the stalk the remaining leaves will feed the bulb for following year after the stem has died completely remove it and discard it is best not to add it to your compost bin supplemental watering may be required if rainfall is not adequate during the growing season remember to apply water directly to the root zone rather than watering overhead lilies should not be waterlogged nor should they be allowed to dry out late blooming lilies such as the orientals and easter lilies and the earlier blooming asiatic have different watering requirements because of their bloom times  check the packaging for specific watering instructions your lily bulbs will naturally increase in size and stem production if after a few years the clump becomes overcrowded or flower production slows markedly it is time to lift divide and share the bulbs this is not difficult and should be done in early fall simply dig deeply around the clump because bulbs can situate themselves as deep as 10 inches into the soil lift the entire clump gently remove the soil and simply pull the smaller bulbs apart replanting them in a wellprepared site so now you know a great way to add color and fragrance to your garden and share these beauties with friends and family ill take that over a chocolate bunny any day joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
starting plants from seed provides greater variety than can be found growing at the garden center starting flowers and vegetables from seed is a great activity especially when you just cant wait any longer to get your hands dirty before spring its an inexpensive project lots of fun for the whole family and the varieties of seed available from multiple sources far exceeds what you can find locally it usually takes six to eight weeks for plants started from seed to be ready for outdoor planting when you start seeds indoors you have better control over the environment and can time your plantings to ensure they are not subjected to freezing conditions which would kill tender seedlings seed trays may be purchased but common household items are just as effective such as small cups or bowls i like the plastic containers that you get at the grocery store or from a takeout restaurant they have a clear plastic lid perfect for watching your progress and keeping moisture in when planting use a seed starting mix that is soilless you can make your own or buy readymade products at any garden center these mixes are light and sterile they are usually made up of a combination of peat moss perlite and vermiculite avoid using garden soil it is too heavy for tender seedlings plus soil contains disease pathogens which can kill your plants when sowing seeds premoisten the mix so the seeds are not disturbed by water after planting it should be about the dampness of a wet sponge assuming the container or tray stays covered the mix should hold all the moisture the seeds need to germinate however not all seeds have the same germination requirements so its best to refer to instructions on the seed packet or elsewhere for specific details next cover the trays with a plastic lid that allows light through but holds moisture in plastic bags work well with adequate moisture condensation will develop inside this tent or cover supplemental lighting is important for best growth a simple shop light consisting of two 40watt florescent bulbs is perfect and very inexpensive place your tray or containers under the lights and positioned just above the container cover the lights should stay on for about 16 hours each day keep an eye on the seeds daily as soon as you notice them sprouting remove the cover too much trapped moisture could cause plants to rot placing a small fan nearby to keep air moving across the soil will help keep new seedlings diseasefree lastly continue to add water as needed to keep the soil moist but not wet once the cover has been removed soil will tend to dry out more quickly be sure to continue to raise your light keeping it to within an inch or two from the tops of your sprouts in about six weeks the seedlings will be ready to transition into the garden starting seeds indoors is just one more element of gardening that i find addictive and a great activity when not much else is going on in the garden as a bonus your seedlings will reward you with months of vivid colors fresh produce and the satisfaction of knowing you had a hand in making it happen joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
in a community garden there is so much potential to learn from or help others i find gardening to be the ideal activity to pass the hours away completely lost in the solitude and pleasure of time alonejust me and my plants honestly i revere those rare occasions of peaceful bliss it is a wonderful break from the busy pace we all seem too caught up in these days however theres another side of me that relishes the opportunity to experience the joys of gardening with others even more there is a certain excitement and energy in sharing such a wonderful activity community gardening is the perfect way to scratch that gardening itch and i love it for even more than simply the social interaction of a shared passion gardens do bring out the best in people and community gardens are a great place to bring it all together first we learn so much from others even as an experienced gardener i always enjoy the contribution of others and admittedly i learn something new all the time on the other hand what a joy it is to be able to share some nugget of wisdom with a budding fellow gardener i still get a kick out of feeling the excitement of those i am able to help improve their skills and its a wonderful opportunity to start an ongoing dialogue with a new friend best of all community gardening provides an opportunity to give back from beautifying a run down or neglected space to unifying a neighborhood or community to donating the harvest to a local food bank or shelter as with the plant a row for the hungry project theres a magnetic quality that seems to draw people into a garden strangers become friends and neighborhoods come together in a community garden it often becomes the catalyst to stimulate social interaction and community development quality of life improves and neighborhoods are beautified and what better way to enhance an unadorned space while creating a place to connect people across intergenerational and multicultural boundaries but community gardens take more than the dedication and determination of its caretakers when it comes to providing the equipment and funding for the start up and ongoing costs involved in smaller projects individuals may chip into the pot its also possible that grants for these plans might be available from the city state or federal government to subsidize such a project even some corporations with an interest in gardening often set aside grant money to promote community gardening efforts fiskars is one such corporate example their grant program code named project orange thumb was started in 2003 the company helps provide community garden groups with the tools and materials they need to reach their goals from neighborhood beautification to horticultural education through 2007 the project has provided over 200000 to more than 100 community groups providing everything from gardening tools to the seeds and plants to get started grants like these from generous corporate and private donors make it possible for groups of all ages and interests without regard to financial means to become involved in their schools and communities through beautification and outreach make friends and get their hands in the dirt all in the name of gardening joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
feed the soil and let the soil feed the plants its one of two axioms i live by when it comes to gardening advice compost that i made from kitchen scraps shredded paper coffee grounds and yard debris the result is black gold for the garden if you can do only one thing for your garden soil add compost but if youre like many i know what youre thinking soil doesnt need the nutrients the plants do so how does feeding the soil help our plants there is another world below the soil surface that most home gardeners dont fully appreciate yet soil scientists tell us that in ideal conditions it is teeming with billions of beneficial microorganisms that provide plants with everything they need to grow and prosper naturally of course that assumes we havent desiccated the soil with excessive salts that come from overuse of synthetic fertilizers instead we should improve the soil with a steady supply of organic matter compost shredded leaves or aged manure to promote plant growth by maintaining a healthy soil food web think of it regarding our own bodies if were trying be as healthy as we can do we fill up on a bunch of junk food every time were hungry or do we opt for something that satisfies our hunger craving but also isnt loading our bodies with a bunch of fat building empty calories its the junk food vs whole foods argument but it can be applied to plants too plants can get their primary nutrients in one of two ways the first is through manmade synthetic fertilizers this is typically saltbased compounds which include nutrients such as nitrogen potassium or phosphorus those chemicals become available to the plant as the particles dissolve or when they pass by the roots as with watersoluble fertilizers to be sure this is a proven way to get nutrients into the plant quickly and it worksvery well but so does junk food to ease your hunger pangstemporarily while your plants will respond to the fertilizer and your taste buds will love the junk food is that really how you want to take care of your health or the health of your plants long term nutrients that arent immediately taken up as they pass by the roots are gone forever and that says nothing about the salt remaining behind to make matters worse the excess and unused chemicals pass through to aquifers or as runoff into watersheds either way the damage downstream to plants wildlife climate and humans can have adverse consequences while its true that it would take a lot of salt residue to significantly harm all the living organisms in the surrounding soil it does have an adverse effect especially cumulatively that brings us to the second method of delivering nutrients to plants the alternative to synthetic junk food fertilizer its organic matter such as compost and organic fertilizer that builds the lasting health of the soil if synthetics are junk food then this organic matter is health food and my method of choice for building longterm soil quality in this method rather than trying to satisfy the immediate craving by supplying a quick fix with no real lasting nutritional value the focus instead is on giving soil what it needs to naturally provide nutrients that are available to plant roots when needed most  the creatures that dwell in soil from those that you can see like these red wiggler worms as well as those you cant such as bacteria and fungi are the great digesters of the organic matter we put into our compost heaps without them and we would have no compost these organic nutrients must first be broken down and digested by soil organisms from bacteria and fungi to other soildwelling creatures including small insects up to the mighty earthworm collectively they release nutrients in an organic form that plants can use while also improving soil structure unlike watersoluble synthetic chemicals organicallyderived nutrients bind to soil particles and are far less likely to leech the net result is a cache of nutrients that remain in the soil until utilized by plants with little risk to plants of burning or dehydration even in periods of extreme drought or overapplication as we continue to feed the soil with organic matter through compost leaf litter worm castings food scraps natural fertilizer etc existing soil organisms utilize these inputs and continue to supply food and nutrients for a soil environment that supports other living organisms and plant life the result is a thriving balanced ecosystem just the way nature intended compost  the best way to feed the soil and how to make it for free there is absolutely no reason you need wait until you have the right system to start composting for years ive been successfully composting in nothing more than a pile this heap was generating heat at nearly 150 degrees who says you need a fancy system not me whether you buy or make it compost is the absolute best way to feed the soil and let the soil feed the plants i believe its the single most important ingredient anyone can add to their garden beyond adding life and fertility to the soil it does so much more compost improves soil drainage yet allows soil to retain sufficient moisture it helps create the type of soil structure that is critical for nutrients and water to be absorbed and roots to spread compost also helps reduce soil erosion and runoff it protects plants from certain diseases moderates ph levels feeds earthworms and other soildwelling creatures supports beneficial microorganisms is known to be a growth stimulant and even buffers toxins in the soil and the best part  you can easily make your own compost natures superfood for free all the ingredients you need come from many things you would otherwise throw away from inside and outside your house if youd rather buy it as simple as it is to make it may make sense for a variety of reasons to buy it instead there are many reputable compost suppliers where you can buy it by the bag or in bulk if you have a large need buying in bulk will save you significant money over bags anything you dont use can be stored for later use i never run out of places for using compost how much to apply the goal is to strive for 5 organic matter by weight in your total plantable area that translates to roughly 30 by volume as a rule oneinch worked into the top fourinches of soil will get you close and provide excellent results to determine how much compost youll need to cover an area use a handy online compost or soil calculator try searching for how much soil do i need all you need to know is the square footage of the area you want to cover and the desired depth in inches and if you want to know that the compost youre buying is the best it can be look for a supplier offering certified compost as designated by the us composting council compost carrying this certification has gone through a series of tests to help ensure what youre buying has passed quality assurance standards for safety and effectiveness noncompost organic nutrients when shopping for other organic alternatives to feed your soil options are often listed primarily by what they are such as blood or bone meal or rock phosphate here is a partial listing of the most commonly available organic nutrients sorted by their role for providing nitrogen phosphorus or potassium nitrogen dried blood blood meal cottonseed meal fish emulsion seaweed extract phosphorus bone meal rock phosphate potassium greensand sulfate of potash somewhere on the package of each youll find those three important numbers representing their total analysis of nitrogen phosphorus or potassium understanding these numbers is the key to knowing what role that product will play in your garden start with a soil test pic 25 caption while formats vary from lab to lab the information in a basic soil test report is generally about the same its an excellent guide to help take the guesswork out of what you need to do if anything to improve the chemical balance of your soil id be remiss in concluding this discussion without mentioning the importance of knowing the current state of your existing soil first all too often i believe we randomly dive into adding inputs in our soil while having no idea whether what were adding is even necessary fortunately youd be hardpressed to cause damage by adding too much organic matter the same cannot be said for inorganic synthetic fertilizers however it should be noted that just because its organic doesnt excuse an overuse of certain inputs for example chicken manure contains high levels of organic nitrogen but put too much of it within contact of your plant roots before its mellowed and chances are youll burn up tender plants a soil test is an important step in assessing what you have to work with tests are available from several sources you can purchase doityourself kits from a garden center online or through mail order sources however diy kits usually dont compare in quality or accuracy to the results you get through your county extension service or private labs for my money the best value and most accurate results come from these experts however most university labs dont routinely provide organic recommendations if you want a report that provides organic equivalents inquire if that option is available from your local extension service or its university soil lab as well as private soil labs that you find online one more time feed the soil and let the soil feed the plants make that part of your new gardening mantra and youll be well on your way to a safer and more environmentally responsible approach to gardening and ultimately a healthier garden overall oh and that other axiom i live by and encourage other gardeners to do the same is this put the right plant in the right place but well save that

during the hot dry days of summer plants and lawns cant seem to get enough water nearly everywhere i look its easy to see the signs of thirsty landscapes a halfinch layer of certified compost applied as a topdressing to your lawn will go a long way to making it healthier and more drought tolerant yet my lawn and garden while certainly on the dry side looks remarkably well especially when considering i dont do anything special to supplement the irrigation its no accident though and not surprising steps i take to prepare for these conditions go a very long way to minimizing the impact of drought and theyre simple things anyone can do three keys to a waterwise landscape in summer one of the very best attributes of compost is its ability to hold moisture in short compost is a mix or organic matter consisting of billions of microorganisms per tablespoon they produce byproducts that are beneficial to other soil dwelling creatures while improving soil texture and structure and thats where the magic happens compost helps bind soil particles together with a substance that absorbs and retains moisture while allowing it to be available to plant roots without compost and organic matter soil becomes dry lifeless dirt leading to much greater problems including soil erosion and runoff soil that includes compost and organic matter acts much like a sponge pulling in water and holding surface particles in place even better mineral particles in the soil consisting of sand silt and clay are held together in various sizes known as aggregates its the binding of these particles that not only allows the retention of moisture but also the ability for excess water to drain its the best of both worlds while we cant change the weather we can plan for it when it comes to protecting the investment of your garden and landscape adding a generous amount of compost should be first on your list its a key component to my waterwise strategy for pennies on the dollar the us composting council suggest that you strive for five percent organic matter in your overall soil profile while it doesnt sound like much theres a good chance your soil has less than that now fortunately a little goes a long way if you want to know how much organic matter your soil currently contains get a soil test theyre inexpensive and full of useful information yet dont wait to add compost its the single best thing you can do for improving the health of your soil improving moisture holding capacity is just one of them disclosure at the time of this writing i am the spokesperson for the us composting council uscc although the thoughts and opinions in this post are indeed my own the uscc who sponsored it compensated me in some way to write it rest assured that i only accept such offers when i genuinely believe in a product or service use it personally or believe it to be good information worth sharing with my audience joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
some will do a little some will do a lot but we should all do something as i sat down to write the introduction to my latest book the green gardeners guide simple significant actions to protect and preserve our planet i realized that this relatively simple assignment allowed me to slow down long enough to put into words why this book is so important to gardeners sure going green is in these days but i believe it is especially important for gardeners and weekend warriors to recognize the impact we have on this whole concept of being ecofriendly as a group we are one of the largest offenders yet possess the ability to make one of the most positive and measurable changes take me for example if you were to find yourself in my garden shed years ago it would look a lot different than it does today back then the floor was crammed with every gas powered tool on wheels the walls crowded and draped with gas trimmers clippers and blowers the shelves were a storehouse for every pesticide herbicide fungicide and fertilizer a gardener could have on hand to handle any real perceived or potential problem over the years ive come around 180 degrees before going green was trendy i began phasing out my own personal arsenal of chemical weapons used to wage war on anything in the garden that i didnt put there myself today i still have plenty of tools but ive done away with the worst environmental offenders my big manly blower has been replaced by a less powerful but more convenient rechargeable model two of my three noisy air polluting lawn mowers have been recycled and the fate of the third is in jeopardy as i look to trade it for a pushpowered reel mower i cant put my finger on a single event leading to this turning point i think for me it was more of a series of personal observations all independent of each other yet collectively working together into an ecological awakening one of the first things to go was the pesticides during my transition it really hit home when i learned how few bugs in any garden are actually considered pests as it turns out its only about 3 and yet how often do we want to eliminate all the bugs just to get the few real offenders and if that werent bad enough if the directions on the label assuming we read them said to use one tablespoon per gallon we use 2 3 5 or even 10 times that because we think more is better in the process of our nonselective all out assaults we are killing entire populations of beneficial insects there to control problems naturally then we felt the need to eliminate certain types of green vegetation that didnt quite meet our standards for appropriate lawns or gardenworthy plants in an effort to get and keep those very lawns and gardens looking green and lush we have carpeted them with herbicides fungicides and fertilizers then we water them to excess wasting an increasingly precious resource in the process as we apply chemicals of every sort to solve any potential problem we rarely think about the consequences the water we waste on our lawns and gardens has led to critical shortages in many areas even the mowers and power equipment we use in a single hour pollutes more than scores of cars at rush hour as well intentioned users of products meant to promote beautiful landscapes and gardens we have become the abusers its time for all of us to be more accountable for the footprint we are leaving behind in fact even if the only change any of us made was to change how we use what we have collectively wed make a significant difference in the positive impact on our environment it all adds up some will do much others very little but if we all do something well be well on our way to creating a more ecofriendly garden not only for ourselves but for the one we all share and cultivate together about joe lampljoe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
ive spent a lot of time lately speaking to audiences both within the gardening and landscaping industry as well as to homeowners that just love to garden in spite of different audiences the message is the same in general are gardeners moving to more ecofriendly and sustainable practices although most homeowners 57 according to the national gardening association say that environmental stewardship is very or extremely important their actions dont yet support those numbers is strictly organic the way to go jeff gilman dispels some of the mystery in his book the truth about organic gardening so whats the disconnect between what they say and what they ultimately do from a number of surveys and conversations ive had with people closely involved with tracking these behaviors its a combination of issues many still perceive the price of organic and natural solutions to lawn and garden issues to be significantly higher than synthetic alternatives others claim they dont believe natural solutions provide as effective results for those willing to try new options many state they cant find them on the store shelves and a large number say theyre confused about what to buy in an attempt to understand more about why things seem to moving more slowly than i had hoped i spoke with jeff gillman author of the truth about organic gardening benefits drawbacks and the bottom line in my efforts to get to the bottom line i asked jeff if he thought organic gardening practices were better for the environment across the board the truth is its just not an absolute as jeff pointed out he quickly went on to explain that without making at least some qualifications you just cant make a blanket claim like that jeffs book was the subject of my latest episode for my weekly podcast series growing a greener world little did i know his answers to some of my questions would likely have at least a few people scratching their head about their organic gardening practices case in point some organic pesticides are bad news for the environment one of the worst offenders is rotenone its highly toxic to fish and other water dwelling creatures although it is being removed from the market as an organic pesticide you can still buy it today sure its organic and natural but so is a snake bite and is that a good thing he adds throughout our conversation jeff cited other examples of not so green things that we ecoconscience gardeners are doing that arent as ecofriendly as we think have a tiller think twice before using it frequent use destroys soil structure another example green sand and rock phosphate are two natural products used as fertilizers yet taken from nonrenewable sources although theyre good for our gardens theyre not good for the planet heres another surprise for many green gardeners did you know that its good to fertilize your lawn at least a little healthy lawns with deeper roots do more to prevent runoff than lawns that arent fed at least occasionally the good news is theres a natural nitrogen source that will keep our lawns healthy and also reduce weed growth jeff likes corn gluten for this and so do i but he adds the problem is it takes two years to work and when it does its not as effective as synthetic preemergent controls i must say i found myself thinking wow jeff do you have to be so academic about this then i reminded myself that he is a phd and assistant professor of horticultural science at the university of minnesota so is the bottom line to all of this bad news to the organic gardening community absolutely not in fact i hope it helps clear up some of the misunderstandings that many gardeners have in regards to their expectations of what when and how to use organic and natural products certainly there is plenty of confusion out there its one of the biggest obstacles to why we still havent embraced more sustainable choices but if we can gain a clearer perspective of realistic expectations going in well thats half the battle in my opinion you can hear my audio interview here joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
knowing the average first and last frost dates for your area is an invaluable tool many anxious home vegetable gardeners seeds are started indoors in february nurtured and nudged along through march and planted outdoors in early april often weeks ahead of the last potential frost sometimes they get lucky defying jack frost with wallowaters cloches cold frames row covers mulch and more the weather can be a funny thing it can lull you into a false sense of security and just when you think frost and freezing temperatures are gone until fall it hits you like a runaway train from the north pole your tender warmseason plants are blindsided by the unexpected but not unlikely late season blast of arctic temperatures you pick up the pieces and start over thinking youve lost weeks of precious time you curse yourself for even trying such a ridiculous scheme the fact is when soil is warmer time lost to frost and cooler temperatures is quickly made up with more hospitable growing conditions by midsummer chances are your spring garden is finishing up looking pretty tired from a productive season but replete with the battle scars of the requisite pest and disease problems you call it a day and put away your tools until next season or do you some diehard vegetable gardeners long to defy mother nature on the other end of the growing season this time extending the gardening season until the first frost of fall but how do you start a new garden in mid summer and expect equally successful results as those from your spring garden there are a number of techniques used to stretch the season one of the simplest steps is to plant your crops in stages this technique is known as succession planting for example if you love freshoffthestalk corn you might not want to plant your entire plot all at once since it will be ready for harvest all at the same time instead stagger the plantings a week at a time or so so that corn is ripening all throughout the growing season other times you may want to start a midseason second planting of your favorite warm season vegetable crops heres what you need to know if you plan on eating homegrown vegetables right up until that first frost of fall 1 know the dates of the average first frost of autumn your county extension service is a good source for this information 2 know the average growing time from seed to harvest its listed on the seed packs or plant label 3 although many root crops and leafy greens dont mind frosty temperatures classic warm season vegetables wont survive know which crops are sensitive to colder weather and time the planting accordingly 4 for warm season crops maturing into fall work backward from the first frost date determine the number of days to maturity and count back to see if you still have time to plant considering all the days involved in the growing cycle 5 before sowing a second crop use a spading fork to turn over the soil and remove any left over roots or buried debris 6 replenish the soil nutrients depleted from the first crop incorporate compost and a balanced slow release fertilizer into the soil before planting seeds or plants that are sown in mid to late summer may start out fast and finish more slowly as day length shortens and temperatures start to cool rapid growth subsides although you can expect great success with your second planting dont expect exactly the same results the shorter days of autumn include lower sunlight levels and reduced solar energy accordingly fruit can be smaller and yields are less on the other hand temperatures are more pleasant pests and diseases have subsided and the dog days of summer have passed thats a tradeoff i can live with any day if it means extending my vegetable gardening season right up to a hard freeze joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
thinning seedlings is an important task for the health of your vegetables spring is the best time to start your vegetable garden in the cold months of winter we drool and dream of the gardens we hope to have by late february some of us have had enough of seed catalogues and tv we set out to start our vegetable seedlings indoors so as not to miss a single day of planting once the risk of frost has passed sowing seeds for anyone who planted in the spring around mid to late april your gardens are now full of tomato plants summer squash peppers eggplants cucumbers southern peas bush and pole beans one of the hardest things for me to do in the early growing stages of a new seedling and i suspect for many gardeners is to pull out perfectly healthy plants from their new home now i must admit as a veteran gardener youd think id get over it but i still treat these first born seedlings like my children i want them all to have an equal chance at making something out of their lives this heart wrenching but necessary process is known as thinning and must be done if seeds are planted too close together most vegetable plants need plenty of room to grow this is so they can receive the most sunlight air circulation and nutrients for them to achieve maximum health and productivity by now youve likely done this important step of thinning if not do so now seed packets always provide the spacing information on the back of each package now you may ask how about sowing seeds more sparingly and then you can avoid this thinning process completely well due to the relatively low price of seeds my preference is to sow more liberally as not every seed will germinate then i have the chance to evaluate and eliminate the inferior seedlings leaving only the strongest for production in the garden and its the strongest plants that will best be able to stand up to the inevitable yet unwanted arrival of pests and diseases uninvited pests there are a number of ways of reducing uninvited pests in your garden first plant early in the season spring is the best time to start many of the worst pests arent out until early summer by then many of your plants will be past their most vulnerable stages and will be tough enough by now to withstand some moderate invasions some pests have a preference for the young tender plants so by the time they get into your garden the plants are well past this stage another way to battle bugs is to use floating row covers row covers are nothing more than a lightweight fabric used to physically cover the young plants like a blanket this fabric is available at most nurseries and gardening seed catalogue companies this material is light enough to let air light and water in but keep pests out this fabric is best used from the time you plant your seeds or seedlings up until just before flowering it is very important that row covers be removed for several days at this stage so bees have access to flowers for pollination once adequate pollination has taken place you may leave the covers off or replace them just be sure that the fabric you choose for this is the lightest you can find so as not to trap excess heat bugs and insects transmit many diseases to vegetable plants the row covers will help greatly in reducing the spread of disease simply by reducing the amount of pests on your plants reducing disease besides pests another of the most common ways vegetable plants get diseases in the summer is through moisture either by overhead watering watering at the wrong time of day rain or by water splashing up to the plant from the soil there are a few simple things you can do to reduce the chances of your plants getting soil born and water related diseases like leaf spot and downy or powdery mildew first mulch mulch mulch think of a protective barrier between the diseases and pathogens in the soil and the plant itself soak the roots only if possible if you do water the foliage do so early enough in the day so that the plant leaves have time to dry before night your goal is to minimize the length of time moisture stays on the leaf surface joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
tulips are just one of the beautiful spring flowering bulbs you can plant in the fall now that fall is here i think a lot about planting and garden maintenance wait a minute when dont i think about that one of the classic gardening activities this season is bulb planting theres no better season and bulbs provide years of enjoyment for very little time and money here are a few bulb planting tips ensure the best results for next season why fall is best if youve been to a garden center anytime after summer youve no doubt noticed the spring flowering bulb displays the reason bulbs are so popular at this time is because they need to be planted in fall in order to perform their best the soil is still warm enough to promote early root growth and a chilling period is still ahead an essential element to a great spring display plant bulbs too early when temperatures are still warm such as late summer or early september and you run the risk of confusing the bulb into thinking its spring spring flowering bulbs need time to chill on average this time ranges around 12 weeks although some bulbs like snowdrops crocus and scilla can get by with around six without the proper length of chill time they wont bloom then or next spring either waiting too late is also a bad idea the ground could be frozen or the bulbs may not have enough chill time before spring arrives again youll get foliage without flowers generally the best time to plant spring flowering bulbs is in october however keep in mind this time will vary depending on where you live in colder climates late september is fine while in warmer areas you can plant right up until late december if the ground is not frozen purchasing bulbs bulbs are available everywhere in the fall including garden centers catalogues mail order suppliers and the internet the advantage to purchasing your bulbs locally is that you can pick them out individually thats important because you want the largest firmest bulbs select larger bulbs they will generally perform better and have a superior display look for firmness which indicate a healthy fresh bulb and avoid any bulb that feels soft or mushy they are well passed their prime and will likely be duds in your garden the disadvantage to purchasing locally is that your selection will be limited online or catalogue ordering is ideal for the largest selection you can preorder any time of year so you have the benefit of actually selecting what you want not only whats available even when you preorder companies that sell bulbs will ship to you at the ideal planting time for your area this takes the worry out of having to store them properly yourself however when the bulbs arrive plant them as soon as possible how to plant bulbs in the absence of specific planting instructions generally bulbs are planted at a depth about three times as deep as the bulb most bulbs have an obvious pointed end that goes up the other end is usually wider and has tiny root hairs when in doubt plant the bulbs on their sides nature will take care of the rest all bulbs prefer fertile well drained soil planting areas that are damp or poorly drained will shorten the life and performance of the bulbs amending the planting area is advised use compost and organic amendments incorporating some bone meal or bulb fertilizer at this time is also helpful and will contribute to the long term performance of your bulbs  look for sites that offer at least six hours of sun for best displays locations under deciduous trees will often work especially for early season bulbs such as crocus snowdrops and some daffodil varieties these work because their foliage and flowers have access to sunlight before the taller trees leaf out the tools used for the physical act of planting bulbs are personal preference you might choose a handheld bulb planter for smaller beds to a shovel for digging larger areas for a more naturalized look or when using many bulbs one trick that works well for both is to use an auger that is designed to be used with a cordless drill you can find these usually wherever bulbs are sold it works beautifully and makes the planting process fun just be sure you have your drill batteries fully charged bulbs look more natural when they appear grouped rather than in a straight line like soldiers in all cases plant in quantity bulbs are inexpensive and have far more appeal and visual impact when you plant in larger groups finally keep in mind newly planted bulbs are attractive to foraging critters as well before calling it a day consider laying down a layer of wire mesh or screen with openings around  inch that will keep the critters from digging up your bulbs and stealing the show for next spring remove the wire before the new foliage emerges next spring in either case a two inch layer of mulch over your newly planted bulbs will not only conceal the screen but will help retain moisture and keep the soil warmer a bit longer so roots can more quickly establish finally water in and maintain adequate moisture to ensure success ongoing maintenance one of my favorite parts about having spring flowing bulbs in my garden is that they are so care free once the initial planting is complete very little is required beyond that to have years of spring color one caution is worth noting once bulbs finish blooming they can become a bit unsightly as the flowers fade and the foliage dies back resist the temptation to cut back the dead foliage too early it is essential that the leaves remain on the plant until they turn completely yellow from flowering until this time those leaves are photosynthesizing providing the nutrients and energy the bulb needs until next year lastly an annual feeding of compost and bone meal rich in phosphorus is important as a nutrient supplement for longlasting performance a synthetic bulb fertilizer can also be used look for one made for bulbs it will have a higher middle number in the analysis ratio on the package for minimal time and money your fall planting work is finished and the reward will be a display of bright and beautiful colors to bring in the spring season for years to come joe lampl is the

its not necessary to have a big garden for a hearty harvest gardening has been a part of my life since i was a kid however it wasnt until recently that i picked up gardening again and i am forever changed because of it last summer i needed to take a few hours of college credits to have a graduate teaching position so i decided to take a gardening course here at texas am university it was really an enjoyable course and has put me on a path of greater happiness for fun i started a small garden in pots or buckets on my patio mostly i grew cherry tomatoes and experimented with other vegetables in pots this worked well enough into the fall but i wanted something bigger my apartment is located on the ground floor with the front facing a decent sized section of ground it occurred to me that i might be able to use a small portion of this area to grow a better garden and increase my options of types of vegetables so i drew some garden plans for a 4 by 8 garden plot and wrote a proposal for the type of garden i was wanting and how i was going to manage it i submitted the proposal to the apartment managers with the hopes that i had a chance in getting permission well i was given permission and i am very happy that i took the chance just ask the garden plot is a simple rectangular plot with 1 by 6 treated lumber enclosing the area this helped me to raise the bed above the mowing area so the yard maintenance crew will avoid damaging my plants and it keeps the grass out and my garden in after building the frame i cut the grass in the rectangular shape and removed it in sections then i dug into the soil to loosen it and in the process found 2 square steppingstones buried in the garden these have come in handy because i am currently using them as steps to reach the interior of my garden without stepping on the soil and risk compacting the soil next i made a trench to put in the rectangular barrier the barrier is staked in with 2 by 4 boards in each corner that are driven about 18in the ground as an added benefit i worked in about 300lbs of compost to help with drainage because this area college station texas is plagued with high clay content i was unable to make my plot level but this has worked in my favor when i am watering the garden because any excess water runs downhill towards the rest of the plants once the plot was ready i needed to pick the plants i wanted because of the small size i needed smaller plants so with a little research and some help from the joe gardener forum board i found a variety of corn called jade blue that makes blue ears of corn and grows less than 4 tall for me currently i have a dozen corn plants 6 jacob cattle bush style beans 2 sweet olive grape tomato plants a sweet basil plant a cilantro bush and an oregano plant so far everything is growing very well and i have already enjoyed having fresh herbs for cooking currently i am working on a ms in geology but it has been made clear to me that this isnt what i would like to do for the rest of my life i have more passion and desire to learn more and more about gardening and this helped me to make a big decision in my life after i get my ms degree i am planning to earn a phd in horticulture with an emphasis on vegetable production and hopefully end up back at texas am to do research and teach people about the benefits of gardening guest author keith jenkins joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
theres something about walking through a nursery and seeing all those beautiful trees and shrubs do you hear them calling your name i do its irresistible and easy to envision any or all of them coming home to live in my garden for many though its another thing entirely to have the same appreciation for plants and trees that are sold as leafless soilless sticks taking up precious space in your garden yet with proper care bare root plants as they are referred to in the trade will deliver spectacular results without many of the problems commonly found when bringing home the more seductive potted options home gardeners just need to see past the awkward stage to get there for the remainder of this article ill refer collectively to bare root trees and shrubs as simply bare roots bare roots get their name from the fact that they are sold dormant and without a container or soil to be sure theyre not pretty to look at in this state yet they are every bit as qualified to adorn your garden or landscape in fact bare roots can often be the better option overall bare roots will never be pot bound a common problem for container grown plants nor will they arrive with any hitchhiking pests or diseases from tainted soil or foliage in addition you can usually find much greater variety options through mail order companies specializing in bare roots most have been field grown for over a year or more before harvesting during the dormant period the soil is washed clean from the roots and the branches are usually pruned back for ease of storage and shipping in storage theyre kept cool to keep them dormantwhich is exactly how you want to receive them for planting in spring it eliminates transplant shock making the transition to your garden trouble free planting bare roots is simple even so there are a few important steps to take to ensure the best chance for success upon arrival inspect each plant to ensure they appear in good condition and that the roots have been kept moist typically with moist shredded paper its best to plant right away however if you will be delayed remoisten or add additional moistened paper around the root area close up the plastic bag and store in a cool location for up to several days if planting will be delayed by more than 10 days transfer your plants to a temporary inground holding area and heel then in the term refers to digging a narrow trench in which to bury the roots you can lay the plants at an angle in the soil and cover the roots keep them moist and transfer to their permanent home when able when planting bare roots in their permanent home soak the roots for several hours in a bucket of water first dig the hole about two times as wide as the roots when you spread them out next pile a mound of the excavated soil in the center of the hole for your plant to sit position the base of the plant onto the center of the mound and drape the roots over the mound root to soil contact is key your goal is to provide a solid base for your plant to sit while making sure the roots are evenly spread and in contact with the soil base it is also important to ensure that the highest point on the trunk where the roots meet is no deeper then the surrounding grade when resting on the mound then back fill with the remaining soil theres no need to amend the planting hole with nonnative soil studies show plants establish faster using just the original soil the final step is to thoroughly irrigate now and for several weeks to come during establishment its especially important at the time of planting to saturate the planting hole so as to settle loose soil and eliminate any air pockets add a threeinch layer of mulch over the soil to help retain moisture in just a few short weeks you should see new growth emerging as you bare root breaks dormancy followed by rapid growth joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
in warmer months chlorophyll masks the potential colors of fall even if you live in the most tropical of climates where summer is your only season you still cant help but marvel at the splendor of a brightly colored autumn vista so whats behind this annual event why do leaves change color every fall and why are some years more vivid in color than others to understand whats involved each fall in the transformation from a sea of cool green to a kaleidoscope of red orange yellow and every shade in between it is helpful to know two important points the timing of leaf color change is primarily affected by the calendar and the intensity is a product of three main factors color pigments length of night and weather first are the pigments there are three most responsible for leaf color most of us are familiar with the first chlorophyll you know it as having something to do with providing the basic green color found in leaves and grass its required for photosynthesis the chemical process that allows plants of all sizes to use sunlight to produce food during the warmer months when plants are actively growing the chlorophyll pigment dominates the color we see in leaves however another pigment is also present at this time carotenoids they produce the yellows oranges and browns but because chlorophyll is so dominate as a pigment it is not until fall when the photosynthesis process shuts down that carotenoid pigments begin to become apparent eventually the photosynthesis process ceases and all chlorophyll is depleted eliminating the green color completely from certain leaves and allowing the carotenoid pigments to take center stage a third pigment anthocyanins are not present in leaves until autumn warm bright days of fall produce lots of sugars in the leaf but as the days shorten and the nights cool these excess sugars are trapped in the leaf as veins leading into and out of the leaves gradually close the combination of bright light and trapped sugars stimulate the production of the anthocyanin pigments they produce the vivid shades of reds and purple and the many hues in between the next factor contributing to fall leaf color is the longer nights days become shorter reducing the amount of sunlight available for plants to photosynthesize this is natures way of signaling plants that winter is on the way energy begins to shift from food and energy production into storage and reserves as the photosynthesis process slows down in response to shorter days so does the production of chlorophyll in the absence of the dominant green pigment carotenoid and anthocyanin pigments light up the fall landscape the third factor and the one most responsible for the intensity of autumn color is the weather the most brilliant fall displays are the result of a warm wet spring a mild summer bright sunny autumn days and cool but above freezing nights when this combination comes together the result is the most vivid color exhibition so as you think back on this seasons display of color hopefully you were rewarded with exceptional views and next spring when its warm and wet be happy it may be the makings of a spectacular fall podcast why trees shed leaves in fall fall leaves are a gift to gardeners using fall leaves as compost joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
plan to move tender plants before temperatures dip into the 40s theres nothing like a cold north wind and fast moving front in late october to signal me that im out of time to get those tender plants and tropicals off the deck or out of the ground so guess what i was motivated to do last night due to the popularity of tropicals and the striking contribution they make to any vista chances are you too have one or more in your garden or on your deck or balcony the good news is youll have them for years to come with some good timing and a little care on your part the trick is to make sure you protect these cold sensitive plants before they succumb to a killing frost or freezing temperatures all tropicals can take the heat but most are highly sensitive to cold weather for the most tender plants temperatures in the 40s can do them in others can make it through a frost or two but take the sign of this colder weather as their signal for dormancy in either case dont expect them to look very good once jack frost has paid a visit some of the most common tropicals include banana caladium elephant ear colocasia spp angels trumpet brugmansia spp hibiscus and one of the most popular structural plants today new zeland flax phormium tenax tropicals can be brought into a bright sunny room and grown as houseplants until next spring arrives however there are a couple of challenges with this scenario first some of these plants have such high light and humidity requirements unless you have a virtual greenhouse dont expect the same lush growth and flowering secondly not many of us have such a room especially with ample space for the larger specimens a more practical solution for many is to store them in a near dormant state in another part of your house or outbuilding a cool dark place one that stays above freezing at night and hovers ideally between 40 and 50 degrees during the daytime is ideal common choices include unheated basements and crawl spaces root cellars garages and potting sheds for this storage option the objective is to keep the part that grows below ground from completely drying out or freezing while allowing the above ground growth to go dormant until next spring here are some of the particulars plants that were growing in containers outdoors can be kept in their containers when moved inside to hibernate tropicals that have been growing in the ground can be dug up and potted or otherwise stored in a frost free area woody plants like hibiscus and angels trumpet should be carefully dug and repotted in a light potting medium the soil should stay only slightly moist but be sure to check it periodically dont be alarmed if most of the leaves fall off the goal is to keep these plants alive but not necessarily stimulate new growth they can be left unpruned or you can cut back a bit to accommodate space requirements because they grow rapidly from new wood in the spring heavier pruning and any fertilizing should be delayed until that time as you remove nonwoody tropicals such as cannas caladium and elephant ears wait until after cold weather or frost has nipped the foliage and started the process of winter dormancy there is no need to preserve the old foliage so cut it back to within a few inches these plants are easy to dig up and over winter the source of next years growth comes from their bulbs corms or tubers for best results allow enough time to rinse them clean and air dry before storing in a cool dark place as described earlier then place them in a container that is well ventilated such as a crate or basket lay the bulbs in peat moss sawdust or a similar substitute and space them so they are not touching each other the material should be light enough to allow air circulation and retain just enough moisture to prevent the bulbs from completely drying out a month or two before next spring approaches you can repot the bulbs for an early start to your spring garden or wait until after the last frost and plant them directly in the ground again either way over wintering tropicals is an easy effective and economical way to keep your plants coming back better than ever year after year joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
remote supplemental watering can be easily accomplished using drip irrigation in a bag in my neck of the woods its been about two months without any measurable rainfall i decided several years ago most plants in my garden were on their own for survival as you can imagine theyre not looking so great right now id plant the right plant in the right place nurse them along until they got established and then it was up to them ive softened a bit since then now i provide occasional supplemental watering to help plants survive summer but in an effort to save time and still water properly im using some very efficient methods water effectively first i water deeply but infrequently this saturates the entire root zone and minimizes the total loss of water due to evaporation by watering only about once a week as the surface area dries moisture is still available more deeply where roots will grow in search of available moisture by watering infrequently roots are encouraged to grow down to find water all of my methods of watering now incorporate this deep but infrequent watering regime and drip irrigation is a great place to start the discussion drip irrigation for beds and containers the best way ive ever seen to keep plants hydrated right at the root zone is with drip irrigation the water is delivered through a supply line which is typically flexible plastic tubing along the supply line small holes punctured into it where needed allowing water to drip out at those points flexible tubing can also be tapped into the line directing water precisely to the base of any plants or containers the rate at which water drips from the end of the tubing is controlled by a plastic tip called an emitter they come in different sizes depending on your desired flow rate drip irrigation kits and supplies can be purchased at garden centers and home improvement stores theyre easy to install add an automatic timer and youll have a worry free way to water effectively portable drip irrigation in a bag there comes a point where it becomes impractical to extend a drip irrigation line too far into your yard or to a remote setting of your landscape that can create a problem as you think about efficient ways to water trees and shrubs treegator is a product that addresses that very issue its essentially a portable drip irrigation system in a bag the bag is a leak proof bladder that has tiny pinholes in the bottom wrap the treegator around the trunk fill it with water and over the next 6  12 hours water is released slowly into the soil there are currently two models one is a cone shaped style that holds 20 gallons of water the second is a more lowprofile style that holds 14 gallons its the ideal solution for watering trees and shrubs in a way that allows the water to slowly soak the area around the roots more information and ordering information is available through their website wwwtreegatorcom the most critical phase of a plant or tree surviving is while it is becoming established in the ground getting sufficient water to the roots is critical having a way to deliver that water slowly enough to soak deeply into the soil is essential using the right drip irrigation method is a great way to assure that happens no matter where your plants are located joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
many gardening activities are best accomplished in the fall wow every week in october and november is my favorite gardening week theres so much to do no bugs no heat no sweat any person with a gardening or landscaping todo list should take full advantage of this welcome opportunity to be very busy here are just a few things that you could or should be doing now lawns if you have cool season turf like fescue or bluegrass you are about out of time to renovate or overseed your lawn however if this is still on your todo list be sure your soil ph is around 60  65 a soil test from your county extension service can give you this information as well as any additional nutrient requirements that might be needed along with the appropriate amounts to add for your lawn however these reports can take a couple of weeks to get back depending on where you live in the country by then you may have missed your window for this season go ahead and add seed now if needed you can add the required nutrients after you get your report keep new grass seed moist you may have to water briefly several times each day until germination try to keep fallen leaves off the seeds if possible without disturbing your seeds in the process vegetables its time to clean up the summer garden many pests and diseases overwinter in old plant debris get it out of your garden and into the compost pile as long as it was not diseased otherwise have it removed from your property hopefully youre growing some cool season crops right now like broccoli spinach and lettuce floating row covers do a great job of providing a few extra degrees of heat and provide frost protection for those tender young seedlings most cool season crops can handle cooler temperatures than you might imagine and many taste even better after a few light frosts if youve never had a fall vegetable garden youre missing a real treat landscaping fall is absolutely the best time of year to plant any tree and shrub the soil is still warm enough for roots to actively grow and yet the demand on foliage growth is waning trees and shrubs planted now have months to develop a healthy root system before the heat of next year be sure to keep your new plants watered the drying winds of the cooler weather can quickly dehydrate your plants check the soil moisture often and water when needed for new plantings provide water once a week in the absence of rain organic gardening dont waste those fallen leaves my single biggest job this time of year is rounding up all of my and my neighbors leaves as they say one mans trash is anothers treasure my neighbors are glad to let me take their leaves off their hands i dump the leaves onto my grass and run my mower over them this shreds them into small pieces which then get raked into my beds they break down rather quickly and are a very good way to add organic amendments to my beds they also pull doubleduty serving as that important layer of mulch over the winter flower gardening plant those bulbs or at least store them in a cool dry place like the refrigerator in cooler climates plant now in southern climates the best time for bulb planting is in middle to late november tulips daffodils crocus iris and hyacinths are all great choices for spring color this is also the ideal time to divide perennials and plant perennial seeds for next spring that should keep you busy for the next few weeks ill be out there too loving every minute of it the best part is that next spring our efforts will be rewarded with a garden that comes alive looking better than ever and due in large part to the work were doing now joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
fall is the ideal time to establish or maintain a fescue lawn now that the fall season has arrived those who were so busy in the summer maintaining and fertilizing warm season grasses bermuda zoysia centipede and st augustine are now able to sit back and enjoy one of the benefits of those types of grasses  dormancy as these warm season grasses wind their growing season down its time for my fescue friends to prepare for the busiest time of year for cool season lawn maintenance renovation and establishment so with that said this fall edition will be focusing primarily on all the todos of the fescue cool season turf owners because fescue has an active growing season during the autumn months this is the best time of year to do whatever work is necessary to have a great looking lawn by spring and one that will better able to endure hot humid summers that cool season grasses are not fond of fall is the ideal time to focus on fescue maintenance because the roots will have plenty of time to establish themselves by spring by the time summer gets here you want fescue roots to be as strong and deep as possible and working your turf in the fall gives you the best chance of success for serious establishment by next summer the ideal window to overseed or seed cool season lawns in the southeast is between september 15 and october 15 the cooler soil gets the slower the germination time becomes a soil test will really help you apply the optimum levels of nutrients this includes lime nitrogen phosphorous and potassium a good soil test one done through your county extension service will tell you this important information and more a practice i like to use is to always aerate my fescue lawn in the fall just prior to overseeding this has several benefits by aerating with a core aerator i am invigorating my root zone by increasing oxygen in the soil and creating openings in which my lime and starter fertilizer have a place to go this is especially helpful if you are adding lime lime does not move through the soil quickly and it takes a couple of months to really be effective so by getting the lime spread just after aerating really helps get it down into your soil same goes for any fertilization you may be doing the cores which get pulled from your soil are only unsightly for a short while any rain or irrigation you do will quickly cause these cores to break down and wash back into the ground overseeding vs starting over a general rule is that if you still have about 50 of your lawn growing than you can overseed with good results however if more than 50 has died than you may want to consider starting over this includes killing the remaining grass and weeds with a nonselective herbicide then seven days later you can safely seed or sod your entire lawn area after the seeding once the seed is down good seed to soil contact is critical for good germination i like to rent a water filled roller to go over my newly seeded lawn area to ensure good seed to soil contact after you seed you might also want to mulch with wheat straw this will help keep the seeds moist and keep the birds away be careful to buy good quality straw otherwise you may end up with hay and end up with a bail full of seed heads that will quickly sprout and be unsightly mixed with the fescue once all this is done make sure you keep your seeds moist until germination this may mean watering briefly several times a day once you get germination start to taper off you watering until the lawn is getting about an inch each week fescue lawns should be fertilized twice in the fall ideally in midseptember and again in midnovember most any lawn fertilizer will do weed control it is a good idea to spot treat problem weeds up to seven days before you plan on seeding you may then apply preemergent weed control in late fall or early winter but only after your newly seeded lawn is well established this will prevent winter annual weeds from being a problem in early spring fescue lawns admittedly are the most labor intensive turf types but to many the bit of extra work is worth it they are rewarded with year round beautiful green lawns joe lampl is the host and executive producer of the award winning pbs television series growing a greener world off camera joe dedicates his time to promoting sustainability through his popular books blog podcast series and nationally syndicated newspaper columns follow joe on twitter,Gardening
emily mullin in 2016 noland arbaugh suffered a spinal cord injury while swimming in a lake the details are fuzzy but what he remembers is rushing toward the water with his friends diving in and hitting his head on somethingor someone he floated to the surface unable to move doctors later confirmed that he was paralyzed from the neck down arbaugh went from being a selfsufficient college student to moving back in with his parents and relying on them for his daily needs he learned how to get around in a wheelchair and use a mouthheld stick to operate an ipad but the hardest adjustment was feeling like he was a burden on his family the year 2016 was also when elon musk cofounded the brain implant startup neuralink this january arbaugh became the first person to receive the companys investigational device dubbed telepathy as part of a clinical trial known as a braincomputer interface or bci it decodes intended movement signals in the brain and translates them into computer commands arbaugh just has to think about moving a cursor on his laptop screen and it moves the experimental device has given arbaugh now 30 a sense of independence before using a mouthstick required someone to position him upright if he dropped his mouthstick it needed to be picked up for him and he couldnt use it for long or hed develop sores with the neuralink device he has nearly full control of a computer he can browse the web and play computer games whenever he wants and neuralink says he has set the human record for cursor control with a bci arbaugh isnt the first person to get a bci one recipient nathan copeland has had one for nine years beyond neuralink several other companies are working to commercialize bcis to help people with paralysis mental health disorders and even blindness arbaugh recently spoke with wired via zoom to talk about his experience in the neuralink study this interview has been edited for length and clarity by carlton reid by steven levy by andy greenberg by celia ford emily mullin before you got the implant what was your daytoday life like noland arbaugh i was lying in bed most days all day i didnt get up a whole lot unless i had something to do i got up to take showers every other day i got up when people would come to my house to see me but outside of that i was just in bed right before my initiation into neuralink i was trying to learn a lot more i was trying to get my life back on track because i had kind of done nothing for five years after my accident so i started learning languages and stuff the two years before the neuralink trial i was actively trying to better myself youve said you found out about the neuralink trial from a friend had you heard of braincomputer interfaces before then no never musk is a very showy person and neuralink has livestreamed some flashy updates over the years what was your initial impression of the company i was blown away at what they were trying to do you know elon musk he has had such an impact on the world whether people think thats good or bad it was really cool knowing that he was a part of something like this i really feel like were kindred spirits with our mentality of wanting to better humanity it was very cool to see the richest man in the world possibly one of the most powerful men in the world taking an interestyou just dont see this kind of funding go into things for handicapped people you had to go through a pretty extensive screening process to find out if you were eligible for the neuralink trial what was that like it took about a month i applied and within a day id gotten an email back that said id been selected and they wanted me to go through the first interview i did a bunch of zoom interviews i had to do a lot of medical screenings they asked about my medical history and family history and i had to do a psych screening at the very end about a month in i went to the hospital they had selected i did a full day of screening which was eight hours of tests including brain scans different head scans blood tests and urine tests i did another psychoanalysis and then memory tests to see if i was all there cognitively and also just to get a baseline so if anything changes they would be able to know where i was when i began that was a long day after that it was just a waiting game when they told you that you had been selected for the trial and were going to get the neuralink implant how did you feel the whole time i tried to keep my expectations really level they told me throughout this whole process that at any point if i dont meet one of their criteria theyll move on in a different direction i tried to push down any expectation i had just because i didnt want to get my hopes up and be let down it was hard to not get excited but i think i needed that to keep me grounded through the whole process by carlton reid by steven levy by andy greenberg by celia ford did you have concerns or fears at any point about getting brain surgery there were a couple of things that gave me pause but i wouldnt call them concerns it was more that i needed to think through it and sort through my feelings and emotions and see if i was really ready to undertake what was coming my way the first is that im a quadriplegic and all i really have is my brain so letting someone go in there and mess around its a big commitment if something goes wrong thats kind of it for me but i knew i wanted to help out and i didnt want to let my fears get in the way of that the second thing that gave me pause was that i didnt know if i wanted to be the first one to get this in my brain if anything would go wrong with the implant what if it breaks or stops working and i only have it for a day a week i thought maybe someone else should get it first and ill get the better version of it did neuralink prepare you for the possibility that the implant might not work i knew there were a lot of risks going in and i knew it might not work i didnt anticipate any of that though i had complete faith in neuralink the day after your surgery musk posted on x that the device was showing neuron spike detection was it really that fast i was lying in my hospital bed right after surgery and they came in and woke up the implant for the first time they showed me a screen with different channels on it and they said they were realtime signals that the neuralink was picking up in my brain so i knew it was working by carlton reid by steven levy by andy greenberg by celia ford my first instinct was to just start playing around moving my fingers to see if i could notice any big spikes every time i moved my index finger there was a big yellow spike and i did it three or four times i was just lying there thinking thats so cool i moved my finger and it jumped and everyone in the room was just geeking out once they started putting me in the app and letting me do things like calibration and body mapping and i got cursor control for the first time it was very intuitive it wasnt hard at all and i think its only going to improve from here by body mapping you mean that you would think about moving your hand or your finger in a certain way and neuralink would correlate that with a certain neural signal yeah so in the body mapping there were visualizations of a hand moving on a screen there were different actions that they had me perform like push your hand forward pull your hand back and so i did that for a while we would do the action during body mapping and they said that same action will be how you control the cursor we did finger presses like pushing down with each of my fingers 10 times then they would say ok this finger got the best signal and so thats the one were going to use for the click so every time i went to click i used that finger it was very intuitive youre not actually moving your finger then just thinking about it exactly even though i cant move it i can still try to move it and it feels like it should be moving the signal is still happening in my brain what does it feel like to be using the device do you have to concentrate really hard no its very easy im constantly multitasking when im in sessions or when im playing around ill throw on an audiobook or throw something on my tv and then play a game at the same time it takes very little brain power what im thinking the whole time is just where i want the cursor to go what devices are you able to use the neuralink app on its just on a macbook right now but theyre planning on moving it onto other devices it will move to a phone pretty soon and well continue going from there neuralink put out a blog post recently about your first 100 days with the device and it mentioned that some of the implants threads which are dotted with electrodes that read your neural activity pulled out of your brain did you notice a difference in functionality when that happened i could tell right away that something was wrong i just started losing control of the cursor that was about three weeks in i would say i thought it was something on their end like they had changed something in the software that made it perform worse by carlton reid by steven levy by andy greenberg by celia ford were you aware that it was possible that the threads could come out i didnt have any knowledge that it was possible i dont think they saw it in any of the animal trials i had heard that it had maybe happened in one of the monkeys but that it was much different it was never anticipated that it would happen in me but there were a lot of things that they didnt expect with the human brain like just how much it moves it threw off a lot of their calculations for how things should be going how long did it take to recalibrate and get back to the cursor speed you were at before it took maybe two weeks i remember the day that it happened i was playing on it and things just got better it was just one little tweak that they had made on the software side and from that point on things kept getting better and better are you worried at all that more threads could pull out and the implant could stop working altogether yeah ive had fears about that ive mentioned it to them they have been very upfront with me and said that they dont see any evidence of that it seems like the threads have stabilized and even some that were pulled out of my brain had found their way back in im not worried about it now how has your life changed since getting the implant its just made me more independent and that helps not only me but everyone around me it makes me feel less helpless and like less of a burden i love the fact that the people around me dont have to wait on me so much outside of being completely healed i believe what most quadriplegics want is independence by carlton reid by steven levy by andy greenberg by celia ford what do you wish you could do with your implant that you cant do right now what does telepathy 20 look like i mentioned this in neuralinks allhands meeting and i think it would be so freakin cool if i had a tesla optimus robot that i could control with it that would do basically everything for me and be a caretaker it would eliminate probably 90 percent of the things that i need other people for on top of that it could connect to other things i could connect to a cara tesla would be pretty cool because theyre already selfdriving i would just need to find some way to get into it and set an address right now its a mission to get me anywhere there are so many people so many moving parts that are involved if i could do all that on my own man it would change everything there are now a few dozen people around the world who have gotten bcis have you met any of them no i havent i would like to maybe i need to take that first step and reach out maybe theyre all mad because ive been breaking world records youll have the implant for at least a year as part of the trial is there a scenario where youd want to have it taken out my thinking through this whole process has been it would benefit neuralink if i left it in as long as possible because ill have the longest case study of anyone i would like to do that if it benefits them that being said if after a year i or neuralink feels as if theyve gotten what they can from me and ive given what i can then well see it also depends on how functional it is i dont expect it to lose any more function but i never know what the future holds by carlton reid by steven levy by andy greenberg by celia ford what has neuralink told you about the possibility of getting an improved model i would love one but they havent promised me anything theyre not allowed to because its seen as an incentive since its a voluntary study im not allowed to be incentivized at all in any way i hope that being the first shortlists me in some way but if this is the extent of my participation then that would be enough for me neuralink is looking for a second trial participant what would you say to that person im excited to have a buddy in this someone to compare notes with it will be nice to get a different perspective i only have a few months on the next participant but i want to help out in any way i can and be available for any questions they have i guess my role in all this is sort of like a big brother what do you think is the next frontier for bcis being able to translate language in real time i think thats doable i know that bcis dont write into the brain yet they just read theres no way to insert knowledge in there but i think if were already at the reading step then maybe writing comes next that is a little bit of a scarier notion and something that i feel like a lot of people might not be too happy with maybe thats something that needs to be thought out a bit more and taken a bit more carefully but i think its a real possibility and its a real bright future,Computing
binary search trees bsts are fundamental hierarchical data structures in computer science renowned for their efficiency in organizing and managing data each node in a bst holds a key value with left and right child nodes arranged according to a specific property nodes in the left subtree have keys less than the parent node while those in the right subtree have keys greater than the parent node this property facilitates fast searching insertion and deletion operations making bsts invaluable in applications requiring sorted data traversal algorithms like inorder preorder and postorder traversals further enhance their utility by enabling systematic node processing bsts find extensive use in databases compilers and various computer science algorithms due to their simplicity and effectiveness in data organization and manipulation this article delves into the theory and practical implementation of bsts highlighting their significance in both academic and realworld applications binary search trees bsts are hierarchical data structures commonly used in computer science to organize and manage data efficiently unlike linear structures like arrays or linked lists which store data sequentially bsts arrange data in a hierarchical manner each node in a bst contains a key value and pointers to its left and right child nodes the key property of a bst is that for any given node all nodes in its left subtree have keys less than the nodes key and all nodes in its right subtree have keys greater than the nodes key this property enables quick searching insertion and deletion operations as it allows the tree to be efficiently navigated based on the value of the keys bsts are particularly useful in applications where data needs to be stored in a sorted order for example in a phonebook application bsts can be used to store names alphabetically allowing for fast lookups of phone numbers based on names similarly in a file system bsts can be employed to store files in sorted order based on their names or sizes facilitating efficient file retrieval operations traversal algorithms such as inorder preorder and postorder traversals allow us to systematically visit each node in the bst in an inorder traversal nodes are visited in ascending order of their keys making it useful for obtaining data in sorted order preorder and postorder traversals visit nodes in a specific order relative to their parent nodes which can be helpful for various operations such as creating a copy of the tree or evaluating mathematical expressions operations on binary search trees bsts involve fundamental actions such as insertion deletion and searching each essential for managing and manipulating the data within the tree efficiently when inserting a new node into a bst the trees hierarchical structure must be maintained to preserve the ordering property starting from the root node the algorithm compares the new nodes key with the keys of existing nodes recursively traversing the tree until an appropriate position is found once the correct location is identified the new node is inserted as a leaf node ensuring that the bsts ordering property is maintained  in the insertion operation we recursively traverse the bst starting from the root node if the tree is empty root is none we create a new node with the given key otherwise we compare the key with the current nodes key and traverse left if the key is smaller or right if its greater we continue this process until we find an appropriate position to insert the new node removing a node from a bst requires careful consideration to preserve the trees integrity the deletion process varies depending on whether the node to be removed has zero one or two children in cases where the node has no children or only one child the deletion process involves adjusting pointers to remove the node from the tree however if the node has two children a more intricate process is required to maintain the bsts ordering property typically the node to be deleted is replaced by its successor either the smallest node in its right subtree or the largest node in its left subtree ensuring that the resulting tree remains a valid bst  in the deletion operation we recursively traverse the bst to find the node with the key to be deleted once found we handle three cases a node with no children a node with one child and a node with two children for a node with no children or one child we simply remove the node from the tree for a node with two children we find the inorder successor smallest node in the right subtree copy its key to the current node and then recursively delete the inorder successor searching for a specific key in a bst involves traversing the tree recursively based on the key values starting from the root node the algorithm compares the target key with the keys of nodes encountered during traversal if the target key matches the key of the current node the search is successful otherwise the algorithm continues searching in the appropriate subtree based on the comparison of key values until the target key is found or determined to be absent  in the search operation we recursively traverse the bst starting from the root node if the current node is none or its key matches the target key we return the current node otherwise if the target key is greater than the current nodes key we search in the right subtree otherwise we search in the left subtree traversal techniques in binary search trees bsts are methods used to visit and process all nodes in the tree in a specific order there are three main traversal techniques inorder traversal preorder traversal and postorder traversal in inorder traversal nodes are visited in ascending order of their keys the process begins at the leftmost node the node with the smallest key then visits the parent node and finally the right child node in a bst an inorder traversal will visit nodes in sorted order  in preorder traversal nodes are visited starting from the root node followed by its left subtree and then its right subtree this traversal method is useful for creating a copy of the tree or prefix expressions  in postorder traversal nodes are visited starting from the left subtree then the right subtree and finally the root node this traversal method is useful for deleting nodes from the tree or evaluating postfix expressions  bsts find applications in various realworld scenarios including efficient implementation and usage of bsts require attention to binary search trees bsts are powerful data structures that play a fundamental role in computer science their hierarchical organization and key property make them efficient for storing retrieving and manipulating data in sorted order by understanding the theory behind bsts and their various operations including insertion deletion searching and traversal techniques developers can leverage their capabilities to solve a wide range of computational problems effectively whether in database systems compilers or algorithm design bsts offer a versatile and elegant solution for managing data and optimizing performance embracing the

python list is a versatile data structure that allows you to easily store a large amount of data in a compact manner lists are widely used by python developers and support many useful functions outofthebox often you may need to work with multiple lists or a list of lists and iterate over them sequentially one after another there are several simple ways to do this in this article we will learn how to go through multiple python lists in a sequential manner let us say you have the following 3 lists  itertools is a very useful python library that provides many functions to easily work with iterable data structures such as list you can use the itertoolschain function to quickly go through multiple lists sequentially here is an example of iterating through lists l1 l2 and l3 using the chain function  using itertools is one of the fastest and most memoryefficient ways to go through multiple lists since it uses iterators this is because iterators only return one item at a time instead of storing a copy of the entire iterable in memory as is the case of for loop sometimes you may have a list of lists as shown below  in such cases you can use a nested for loop to iterate through these lists  alternatively you can also use itertoolschain to go through a list of lists  the abovementioned methods work with most python versions but if you use python 3 then you can also avail the star  operator to quickly unpack a list of lists  so far in each of the above cases all items of the first list are displayed followed by all items of the second list and so on but sometimes you may need to sequentially process the first item of each list followed by the second item of each list and so on for this kind of sequential order you need to use the itertoolsizip function here is an example to illustrate it  notice the difference in sequence in this case the output is the first item of each list 1 4 7 followed by the second item on each list 2 5 8 and so on this is different from the sequence of the first list items 1 2 3 followed by second list items 4 5 6 and so on in this article we have learned several simple ways to sequentially iterate over multiple lists in python basically there are two ways to do this the first approach is when you need to process all items of one list before moving to the next one the second approach is where you need to process the first item of each list then the second item of each list and so on in the first case you can use the itertoolschain function a for loop or a star operator in the second case you need to use the itertoolsizip function opinions expressed by dzone contributors are their own,Computing

the pathway leading into rabbits venue for the launch event of the r1 an artificialintelligencepowered device announced at ces 2024 was paved with gadgets from the past first was the orange jvc videosphere then the sony walkman a tamagotchi a transparent game boy colorheck even the original pokdex toy from 1998 at the very end of the hall was teenage engineerings pocket operator and across from it a few concept prototypes of the rabbit r1 if the pocket operator stands out seeing as its barely a decade old thats because the swedish design firm teenage engineering helped design the r1 and at the launch event rabbit ceo jesse lyu announced on stage that jesper kouthoofd founder of teenage engineering had joined rabbit as its chief design officer while still maintaining his role as ceo of te but this red little retro gadget isnt just pulling our nostalgia strings and taking design cues from the second half of the 1900s rabbit is also making a bold claim that its r1 deserves a spot in this tech hall of fame rabbit confirmed that an r1accompanying camera wearable is inbound that will allow the device to know by image alone what youre pointing at or commanding it to control even the venue being the iconic twa hotel at john f kennedy international airport in new yorkwhich very much feels like a liveaction set of the jetsons and boasts a restored lockheed constellation connie l1649a thats been repurposed into a cocktail loungeunderscored this yearning for the fun gadgetry of the past and the exciting promise of future glory fifty years from now the r1 is that gadget youll reminisce about the one that was at the start of the aifueled world at least thats what lyu hopes our mission is to create the simplest computer lyu announced on stage to a captive audienceand over the course of an hour lyu laid out plans to achieve this goal the r1 it turns out is just the start by carlton reid by david nield by julian chokkattu by eric ravenscraft i went over the minute details of this new ai device when i first reported on it from ceshow its orangered no bigger than a stack of postits and has a little screen on the right of the screen is a scroll wheel for interacting with the interface and above it is a camera that can swivel to the front back or into the inner casing of the device for privacy on the right edge is a button which is the main way to select anything on the screen the r1 can perform actions like manipulate spreadsheets translate languages generate ai images and order you a mcdonalds much like with the humane ai pin you can talk to this device as you would chat with alexa siri or google assistant and ask anything its quite smart so you can ask complex questions and in a natural wayits mainly powered by perplexitys large language model which helps it understand your query and deliver the answer via the speakers and screen theres no hot word to activate the microphoneyou just have to push the side button and talk like with a walkietalkie the camera enables visionpowered ai tricks too so you can point the camera at a subject and the r1 can understand and parse what youre looking at lyu had a live demo on stage where he pointed the r1s camera at a spreadsheet printed on a piece of paper as it captured a photo he asked the device to swap the placement of two columns around and to send him a copy within seconds an email appeared in lyus inbox on his computer with a digital version of the spreadsheet purportedly with the request addressed the r1 has quite a few other builtin tricks you can take notes and access them via the rabbit hole web portal and even edit them it can handle translations with ease as again demonstrated live on stage you can make voice recordings on the device access the wav file in the web portal and get an ai summary of the recording theres a builtin virtual keyboard when you need to type anything into the interface like a wifi password by carlton reid by david nield by julian chokkattu by eric ravenscraft the launch event in new york saw users get their hands on the r1 for the first time lyu demoed the r1s teach mode as well which lets you point the r1s camera at a computer screen as you instruct it how to complete a task after it learns you can ask it to perform said task to save yourself the time and hassle however this feature is not yet available and when it is rabbit says it will start with a small selection of users to beta test it but the goal for the r1 is more or less to replace your apps instead of hunting for an icon just push the button and ask the r1 to handle something at ces it seemed as though youd be able to access multiple thirdparty apps through the r1 at launchbut right now there are just four services uber doordash midjourney and spotify you connect to these via the rabbit hole web portalwhich means yes you are logging in to these services through what seems to be a virtual machine hosted by rabbit handing over your credentialsand then you can ask the r1 to call an uber order mcdonalds generate an image or play a song it has been trained to use these websites but it is not accessing these services application programming interfaces apis rabbit ceo jesse lyu says that more functionality is coming for the r1 including travel planning by carlton reid by david nield by julian chokkattu by eric ravenscraft lyu promises that theres plenty more on the way of course we are told to expect in the summer an alarm clock calendar contacts gps memory recall travel planning and other features currently in development are amazon music and apple music integrations and later on we should see more thirdparty service integrations including airbnb lyft and opentable you might be wondering hang on a minute that just sounds like a phone and you  wouldnt be off the mark as weve seen with the clunky and limited humane ai pin a smartphone can perform all of these tasks better faster and with richer interactions this is where you have to start looking carefully at rabbits overall vision the idea is to speak and then compute no need for appsthe computer will just understand we are a long ways away from that but at the launch event rabbit teased a wearable device that would understand what youre pointing at lyu suggested the wearable would be able to understand you pointing at a nest thermostat and asking to lower the temperature without having to say the words nest or thermostat the image of the supposedly allseeing wearable was blurred though so we dont have much information to go on lyu mentioned generative user interfaces where a user would be able to have an interface of their own choosingbuttons on a screen placed where you want them and at the perfect display sizeand then claimed that rabbit is working on an ainative desktop operating system called rabbit os again we dont have many details but my mind immediately went to theo in her installing os1 on his pc an operating system that puts a personal voice assistant front and center what could go wrong the rabbit r1 retails for 199 and is available for purchase now but units are shipping in batches and currently if you place an order youll get a unit in june lyu wont stop repeating that this device doesnt have a subscriptionunlike the humane ai pinbut its worth noting you have to purchase your own monthly data plan and insert the sim card into the 4genabled r1 for it to be useful when youre away from wifi unless you plan to tether it to your phone the company says it has sold 100000 units in the first quarter of 2024 i picked up my unit at the event and have now unboxed it my early impressions are that its undeniably a cute piece of tech but ill have more thoughts lined up in a review after ive put it through its paces if you buy something using links in our stories we may earn a commission this helps support our journalism learn more,Computing
googles android mobile operating system is open source which means anyone can in theory build their own mobile operating system based on the android open source project aosp why then are there not many different versions of android to choose from well the good news is that there are a few alternatives to androidsome of them are excellent if not better than the version of android that ships with your smartphone but the reason there are only three or four good options highlights the fact that there is more much more to the mobile experience than the operating system androids operating system is open source but it runs devicespecific drivers and googles various play services application programming interfaces apis with a suite of builtin apps for basic functionality all of this stuff is another layer atop the android operating system and its this layer thats very difficult for other projects to reproduce its not hard for projects to get the aosp code running but its difficult to create a great mobile user experience on top one project that has created a great user experience on top of aosp is eos for the past six months ive used nothing else and i am here to say that the world of android alternatives has never been better if youre looking to get out of the google box come on in the waters fine if you buy something using links in our stories we may earn a commission this helps support our journalism learn more its worth pausing here to answer the question of why youd want to use an android alternative like eos despite my general dislike of surveillance capitalism it was not privacyrelated issues that initially drove me from android but poor user experience i got tired of androids constant updates every time i picked up my phone the internet was ridiculously slow because android was downloading yet another update and prompting me to install it i lived through windows 98 once was enough this was some years ago and i did not know about eos when i decided to ditch android i installed lineageos probably the bestknown android alternative and never looked back lineageos is a solid platform and provides a good set of basic applications i never had any trouble with the open source apps i primarily rely on nor did i have much trouble with the handful of proprietary apps i use outside of work i dont depend on or use any google services so my transition from stock android was smooth however due to my position at wired i still needed to install the google play services layer on lineageos to access the apps i needed for workslack airtable and gmail while i like lineageos the fact that google was still embedded into my device bothered me because my perspective changed the boot screen was what did it by carlton reid by david nield by julian chokkattu by eric ravenscraft when you unlock the boot loader of your android phone which is necessary to load an alternative os theres a message every time you reboot warning that software integrity cannot be guaranteed that is true it cant and that could be bad if you happen to be jason bourne more on this below but what bothers me isnt the technical details but the underlying assumptionnamely that the corporation making your device can be trusted perhaps i read too much into these things perhaps i dream too much of the unlikely future where mobile devices are generalpurpose computers modifiable as you see fit whatever the case i certainly dont trust device manufacturers or google especially on my phone and i wanted google out of my lineageos i needed something to replace the google play services layer a step necessary because google is nothing if not clever while android is open source google has taken a page from the microsoft playbook of old and uses things like its play integrity apis to ensure that apps will only work with googles version of android this way google can wave the open source flag while effectively preventing downstream forks from working many of the developers i spoke with in my research for this story believe these anticompetitive practices will ultimately be regulated by governments the problem is that what google has done is subtle complex and built out of code which is difficult for nontechnical people to parse whichever way it shakes out legally in the meantime a tremendous amount of effort has gone into trying to replicate these proprietary apis to ensure mobile applications will work on alternative operating systems luckily for me i am not the first person to need a google play service alternative there are several options out there but the best in my experience is the micro g project micro g is a free software clone of googles proprietary core libraries and applications replacing most of the proprietary apis google uses this means your degoogled phone can still handle geolocation correctly along with a few other core services that thirdparty apps expect by carlton reid by david nield by julian chokkattu by eric ravenscraft i ended up combining lineageos and micro g to have a phone that was fully degoogled but also fully functional the catch is that installing lineageos and micro g requires a little technical expertise youll need to be comfortable running software from the command line this is where we finally get back to eos installing lineageos is not for everyone thats one of the main problems eos set out to solve and indeed it hasyou can buy a fairphone preloaded with eos and have an excellent googlefree mobile experience with no installation hassle i tested eos on a fairphone 4 provided by murena the company that handles the hardware eos supports murena also sells refurbished pixel 5 phones preloaded with eos as well as its own murena one and murena 2 not currently available in the us i did not specifically test murenas refurbished pixels but when it was time to send back the fairphone i loaded eos on a pixel 6a and continue to use it to this day if youve installed lineageos the process for eos is nearly identical aside from the files youre side loading so what exactly is eos well it starts with a base system of lineageos adds in micro g to handle all the google api things and then focuses on replicating the rest of a good mobile os experiencesyncing data through its servers providing online backups and making sure all your favorite apps run as expected thats very similar to what i achieved on my own with lineageos and micro g but with zero effort on the users part thats not what makes eos special though the real difference between eos and other versions of android is the privacyfirst design the core of the privacy features lies in what eos calls the advanced privacy app and widget here you can block inapp trackers and there are other features such as hiding your ip address or geolocation when you feel like it the ip and geo spoofing are nice for limiteduse cases but the main privacy feature for most of us is the ability to block trackers in appsand it turns out there are a lot thanks to the advanced privacy app i can tell you that in the past 10 days eos has blocked 3030 app trackers from contacting tracking servers the depressing thing about using eos is seeing in stark detail how many apps are constantly transmitting data back to servers sure eos blocks it all for you so youre not transmitting anything but everyone else is and thats sad thanks to the advanced privacy app i can tell you that in the past 10 days eos has blocked 3030 app trackers from contacting tracking servers thats from just 15 apps while there are apps i am not surprised to see on this list like deltas app which i had installed for a trip there are others i was disappointed to see on there like my birding apps both audubons app and cornells ebird app contain trackers ironically eoss system app is also on this list yes out of the box eos blocks itself by carlton reid by david nield by julian chokkattu by eric ravenscraft while i like the privacy features of eos and have even taken to spoofing my geodata much of the time the real killer feature to me is the eos app store which is named the app lounge when i used lineageos i installed apps from several different app stores theres fdroid which hosts open source apps and uptodown which a few apps i use support vivaldi being the main one and then i had a few i could only get through the google play store as anyone using lineageos can tell you its a lot to keep track of the eos app lounge combines apps from a variety of sources including the play store and fdroid among others making them all available in one place you can also opt to only show open source apps also nice is the option to stay anonymous when connecting to any of the app stores although you will need to be logged in to get the apps you paid for since those are tied to your user id i have also had the anonymous login fail a few times giving me token errors this is one of the few places ive had issues with eos the app lounge uses a familiar design that looks like google play but adds a few features the first is that app lounge provides privacy information about each app grading it on a 1 to 10 scale where 1 is horrible for privacy and 10 generally means no trackers the app lounge also grades apps according to which permissions they require the fewer permissions like access to your photos or geodata the higher the rating its a nice way of providing complex information in a way anyone can easily parse in a win for the larger androidalt community eos claims to be working on making the app lounge available as an app that can be installed anywhere in the meantime the aurora store is a close alternative as much as i love eos its not perfect ive had some minor issues with geodata i live on the road so my location changes every couple of weeks sometimes eos is slow to pick up on this and the maps app will show me search results based on where i was last week the included maps app itself is still rough around the edges and uses some proprietary code its better and more accurate than every other map app ive tried but it isnt as good as google maps i dont care what you think of google its maps app is unmatched i still use it as a backup when the default eos app doesnt find what i need the other big missing feature for me is speechtotext right now eos ships without speechtotext at all theres a good summary of the options available in the eos forums none of them are ideal but ive managed to get by with a combination of sayboard and the stock eos keyboard the good news is that a builtin speechtotext feature is on the road map for eos in 2024 this will also open the door to an eos assistant which is not currently available the project is unclear about what form this might take given the privacy implications of interacting with a server to answer queries but one possibility is a large language model running locally by carlton reid by david nield by julian chokkattu by eric ravenscraft the other missing option is a full backup at the moment your media calendar contacts and files are backed up if you create a murenaio account but applications and any settings or data are not backed up again hopefully that will be changing later this year in my experience apps generally work fine i have not had any problems running apps beyond those mentioned above i would be remiss not to point out that installing alternative operating systems on your phone requires unlocking the boot loader which does open a door to attackers unfortunately relocking the boot loader often does not go well i have never tried it given that its an easy way to brick your phone the reason phones ship with locked boot loaders is to protect against a kind of attack called evil maid it would also protect against a rootkit being installed the way boot loader locking prevents this is to require a private encryption key which only the phone manufacturer has to sign the os thats about to load without this key the os isnt allowed to load this ensures that third parties dont modify or replace the operating system with malicious versions the question is is it bad to have an unlocked boot loader if you are the target of an attack by statelevel groups then yes you should not use unlocked boot loaders as i said above if youre a superspy avoid eos or lineageos or anything else also avoid using a phone at all in the world most of us live in no hackers are posing as waiters to swipe our phones over lunch and install malicious operating systems which is what you have to do to pull off a boot loader attack a boot loader attack requires the attacker to gain possession of the hardware by carlton reid by david nield by julian chokkattu by eric ravenscraft i have been running various mobile operating systems for years with unlocked boot loaders and have not had an issue i bring this up mostly because everyone should be informed and make this choice for themselves in my case i know there is an insecurity here and i am ok with it also to be clear despite my initial dislike of the unlocked boot loader message above this issue is not googles fault its the hardware makers fault there is a system that handles your phones boot loader just like microsofts uefi system works on a laptop but hardware manufacturers have not implemented it google has it in the pixel phones so i can in theory relock my boot loader but i dont the risk of a bricked phone is more real in my case than the risk of an evil maid attack its also worth noting that if you want an os that can relock the boot loader grapheneos makes that possible i have not used grapheneos yet but it is another good option for me though eos does everything i need and does a good job of staying out of my way the rest of the time a phones operating system may not matter to everyone but if youre someone who wants to leave the binary world of apple and google behind eos is well worth a try head over to the eos site for installation instructions you can see what

on a stifling april afternoon in ajmer in the indian state of rajasthan local politician shakti singh rathore sat down in front of a greenscreen to shoot a short video he looked nervous it was his first time being cloned wearing a crisp white shirt and a ceremonial saffron scarf bearing a lotus flowerthe logo of the bjp the countrys ruling partyrathore pressed his palms together and greeted his audience in hindi namashkar he began to all my brothers before he could continue the director of the shoot walked into the frame divyendra singh jadoun a 31yearold with a bald head and a thick black beard told rathore he was moving around too much on camera jadoun was trying to capture enough audio and video data to build an ai deepfake of rathore that would convince 300000 potential voters around ajmer that theyd had a personalized conversation with himbut excess movement would break the algorithm jadoun told his subject to look straight into the camera and move only his lips start again he said at polymath synthetic media solutions selftaught deepfaker divyendra singh jadoun collects video and audio data of local politicians in order to translate their speech into different languages for voter outreach here shakti singh rathores speech is generated in hindi tamil sanskrit and marathi video nilesh christopherdivyendra singh jadounwired right now the worlds largest democracy is going to the polls close to a billion indians are eligible to vote as part of the countrys general election and deepfakes could play a decisive and potentially divisive role indias political parties have exploited ai to warp reality through cheap audio fakes propaganda images and ai parodies but while the global discourse on deepfakes often focuses on misinformation disinformation and other societal harms many indian politicians are using the technology for a different purpose voter outreach across the ideological spectrum theyre relying on ai to help them navigate the nations 22 official languages and thousands of regional dialects and to deliver personalized messages in fartherflung communities while the us recently made it illegal to use aigenerated voices for unsolicited calls in india sanctioned deepfakes have become a 60 million business opportunity more than 50 million aigenerated voice clone calls were made in the two months leading up to the start of the elections in apriland millions more will be made during voting one of the countrys largest business messaging operators told wired jadoun is the poster boy of this burgeoning industry his firm polymath synthetic media solutions is one of many deepfake service providers from across india that have emerged to cater to the political class this election season jadoun has delivered five ai campaigns so far for which his company has been paid a total of 55000 he charges significantly less than the big political consultants125000 rupees 1500 to make a digital avatar and 60000 rupees 720 for an audio clone hes made deepfakes for prem singh tamang the chief minister of the himalayan state of sikkim and resurrected y s rajasekhara reddy an iconic politician who died in a helicopter crash in 2009 to endorse his son y s jagan mohan reddy currently chief minister of the state of andhra pradesh jadoun has also created aigenerated propaganda songs for several politicians including tamang a local candidate for parliament and the chief minister of the western state of maharashtra he is our pride ran one song in hindi about a local politician in ajmer with male and female voices set to a peppy tune hes always been impartial jadoun also makes aigenerated campaign songs including this one for local politician ram chandra choudhary in ajmer translated into english the lyrics read for ajmer he brought a new gift  his name is ram chandra  he helps everyone  he was the president of ajmer dairy  he has always been impartial  he has ram in his name  he is our pride  hes a soldier of the congress  shares public anguish  son of ajmer  a guardian of development  son of ajmer  true form of development  fight for everyones rights  ram chandra played the clarinet audio divyendra singh jadoun while rathore isnt up for election this year hes one of more than 18 million bjp volunteers tasked with ensuring that the government of prime minister narendra modi maintains its hold on power in the past that would have meant spending months crisscrossing rajasthan a desert state roughly the size of italy to speak with voters individually reminding them of how they have benefited from various bjp social programspensions free tanks for cooking gas cash payments for pregnant women but with the help of jadouns deepfakes rathores job has gotten a lot easier hell spend 15 minutes here talking to the camera about some of the key election issues while jadoun prompts him with questions but it doesnt really matter what he says all jadoun needs is rathores voice once thats done jadoun will use the data to generate videos and calls that will go directly to voters phones in lieu of a knock at their door or a quick handshake at a rally theyll see or hear rathore address them by name and talk with eerie specificity about the issues that matter most to them and ask them to vote for the bjp if they ask questions the ai should respondin a clear and calm voice thats almost better than the real rathores rapid drawl less techsavvy voters may not even realize theyve been talking to a machine even rathore admits he doesnt know much about ai but he understands psychology such calls can help with swing voters brushing shoulders with politicians isnt new for jadoun he used to be one in 2015 he stood for election in ajmer as district president of the national students union of india nsui the youth wing of the indian national congress the once formidable national party thats now the chief opposition to modis bjp by carlton reid by emily mullin by steven levy by andy greenberg jadoun always had a knack for selfpromotionthats why his friends persuaded him to run during the campaign he hired four shotgunwielding gunmen to escort him around town in opentop jeeps in hopes of creating a powerful persona when you have gunmen with you others start feeling envious he said wherever i would go these gunmen would come with me sometimes they would fire off a round or two into the air but one day he took it too far and entered a polling booth with loaded weapons sparking a national debate on lawlessness in smalltown india still jadoun won the election and two years later he became the state general secretary of the nsui for rajasthan as nsui leader he gave rousing speeches in front of large crowds at rallies posed for pictures with impoverished children and traveled across rajasthan to meet politicians and strengthen his network but five years in he felt suffocated by politics he had dropped out of college and he realized that while all the people around him elevated him he was also beholden to them i used to get calls at 2 am to handle situations he says i realized that my time and my life werent mine any longer the covid lockdowns were a blessing stuck at home away from politics he started an experiment a series of 30day challenges where hed spend a month learning a new skillplaying the flute mastering graphic design trading on the stock market becoming ambidextrousto see whether that would help him figure out the next phase of his life in october 2020 he saw the music video for the black eyed peas song action which inserted the singers faces into indian movies he started hanging out in reddit forums and tinkering with faceswapping software in october of that year he set himself the 30day challenge of gaining 10000 instagram followers he created an account called the indian deepfaker and started reimagining clips from movies and tv shows using open source software deepfacelab one put the actors from breaking bad into an indian soap opera another turned bollywood actor shah rukh khan into iron man this content can also be viewed on the site it originates from by carlton reid by emily mullin

to newlyweds from their deceased parents it dawned on him that he could actually make a living doing this i was offered 800 1000 for one assignment he says i lost my mind when netflix hired him to work on an internal tribute video for an employee swapping his face onto the characters in the series he had worked on jadoun flaunted the nondisclosure agreement on instagram in 2022 sagar vishnoi a sharp and slick political consultant from the small town of chandigarh spotted some of jadouns work online vishnoi had pioneered the use of ai for political campaigns in india and made headlines in

unsanctioned deepfakes to target their political opponents factcheckers have identified several prominent audio and video deepfakes targeted at influencing voter opinion in india there have been clones of politicians saying things they didnt and politicians crying deepfake to deny saying things that they did by carlton reid by emily mullin by steven levy by andy greenberg jadoun says hes now had more than 250 messages asking for this kind of job but he is clear about not using deepfakes to spread misinformationpartly because of what happened in november 2023 when he got embroiled in a

standards the story made headlines across india prime minister modi gave a speech warning against the misuse of deepfakes a police complaint was issued to find the perpetrators jadoun had done some work for mandanna in the past and many of his instagram followers thought he was the culprit the suspicion was on me because i had her facial data and everything he says at one point jadoun received a visit from three plainclothes police officers and was briefly afraid they would ask him about the mandanna deepfake but they had come to ask for his help in figuring out whether a hindi audioclip of a politician was a deepfake or not after that jadoun moved away from making deepfakes for fun and doubled down on politics shortly before the recording session with rathore jadoun was one of three signatories to an ethical ai coalition manifesto that pledged to not use ai tech for nefarious ends from a oneperson operation working out of his bedroom jadoun has now expanded to a ninemember team

personalized ai calls during the two weeks leading up to the general election in the southern states of telangana and andhra pradesh alone while urban voters perceive unsolicited calls as a nuisance the political consultants we spoke to say rural users often feel an elevated sense of importance after receiving calls from those in high positions voters usually want the candidate to approach them they want the candidate to talk to them and when the candidate cant go door to door ai calls become a good way to reach them said abhishek pasupulety a tech executive at itoconnect pasupuletys confidence in the ai approach is based on his companys experience of the previous round of state elections in 2023 back then itoconnect delivered 20 million telugulanguage ai calls for 15 politicians

existing video it is possible to track down the original and see how it has been manipulated he says the challenge with fake audio alone is that often there is no reference there is no original to find but sanctioned deepfakes muddy the waters too even when people are happy to receive them delightingly deceiving voters doesnt excuse the deception says gregory just because someone pulled the wool over your eyes while smiling at you doesnt change the fact that they deceived you the key problems with deepfakes are lack of consent disclosure and content gregory says theres a thin line here between voter engagement candidate humanization and deception that has a lot to do with familiarity with a given technology he says were used to getting personalized emails and lettersbut voice

a day for upcoming state elections later this year the cost savings are attractive but he hasnt been that impressed with the quality of the aibased call center solutions pitched to him so far what they promise and what they deliverthere is a huge gap mogra said they promise you a red ferrari and you will get a red fiat in some of the calls the ai was hallucinating and in one call it spoke so loudly it felt like someone was screaming before we left jadouns home office in april he demonstrated the fruit of his afternoons labors ai agent calls where the caller has a backandforth conversation with a convincing clone the callers speech is turned into text which is fed into the large language model mistral to draft a humanlike reply which is then turned into an audio response in the voice of whichever politician they think theyre talking to it wasnt really working what we witnessed was riddled with delays in the machine response anglicized pronunciations and hallucinations on one occasion the ai got stuck in a loop repeating the same phrase over and over regardless of the question on another it introduced itself in english as rathores ai avatar when jadoun tried to deploy an ai agent version of rathore to real voters the results were equally disastrous in some of the calls the ai was hallucinating and in one call it spoke so loudly it felt like someone was screaming he said for

but economists say it could be offset by the creation of new roles and nonautomated sectors breakthroughs in artificial intelligence could lead to shortterm increases in unemployment a rise in carbon emissions and leave regulators trailing in the wake of technological advances according to an international panel of experts the inaugural report on the safety of advanced ai inspired by the intergovernmental panel on climate change raised a number of concerns about a technology which has shot up the political and regulatory agenda after leaps forward such as the chatgpt chatbot the panel behind the study chaired by the leading computer scientist yoshua bengio acknowledges there is far from universal agreement about the technology ai has tremendous potential to change our lives for the better but it also poses risks of harm said bengio bengio was commissioned by the uk government to preside over the report which was announced at last years global ai safety summit at bletchley park with the panel members nominated by 30 countries as well as the eu and un released in advance of next weeks successor ai summit in seoul  where rishi sunak will cochair the opening session by video link  the report focuses on generalpurpose ai the term for computer systems that can perform a wide variety of tasks typically associated with intelligent beings broaching one of the most sensitive aspects of the technologys impact the panel says ai could have a significant impact on the labour market by allowing the automation of a number of tasks as well as chatgpt a textgenerating tool that is also highly adept at writing software code recent advances have brought products that can produce highly convincing video image and audio from simple handtyped prompts  potentially threatening a host of professions the report says many people could lose their jobs but adds that some economists believe redundancies could be offset by the creation of new roles due to the technology and demand in nonautomated sectors it also cites an international monetary fund paper that says 60 of jobs in advanced economies are exposed to ai although that could result in a range of outcomes  from automating substantial parts of someones job to complementing it however the gap between workers learning new skills or moving location for fresh jobs could still result in shortterm unemployment labour market frictions such as the time needed for workers to learn new skills or relocate for new jobs could cause unemployment in the short run even if overall labour demand remained unchanged it says the report also raises environmental concerns by flagging the growing use of datacentres to train and operate the ai models that underpin products like chatgpt this trend might continue potentially leading to strongly increasing co2 emissions the report says adding that it could make ai the largest contributor to datacentre electricity consumption in the near future the seoul summit is taking place against a backdrop of increased political and regulatory activity related to ai in the uk us and eu the panel warns that regulators could be caught out by the rapid pace of change referring to the potential disparity between the pace of technological progress and the pace of a regulatory response other potential risks raised in the report include concerns around bias reflected by the fact that widely used ai models are trained on data that disproportionately represents western cultures as well as fears over losing control of ai systems the report concludes that the near future around general purpose ai is uncertain with very positive and very negative outcomes and the decisions of societies and governments will play a key role in how the technology progresses,Computing
tech experts hope new term for carelessly automated ai webpages and images can illuminate its damaging impact your email inbox is full of spam your letterbox is full of junk mail now your web browser has its own affliction slop slop is what you get when you shove artificial intelligencegenerated material up on the web for anyone to view unlike a chatbot the slop isnt interactive and is rarely intended to actually answer readers questions or serve their needs instead it functions mostly to create the appearance of humanmade content benefit from advertising revenue and steer search engine attention towards other sites just like spam almost no one wants to view slop but the economics of the internet lead to its creation anyway ai models make it trivial to automatically generate vast quantities of text or images providing an answer to any imaginable search query uploading endless shareable landscapes and inspirational stories and creating an army of supportive comments if just a handful of users land on the site reshare the meme or click through the adverts hosted the cost of its creation pays off but like spam its overall effect is negative the lost time and effort of users who now have to wade through slop to find the content theyre actually seeking far outweighs the profit to the slop creator i think having a name for this is really important because it gives people a concise way to talk about the problem says the developer simon willison one of the early proponents of the term slop before the term spam entered general use it wasnt necessarily clear to everyone that unwanted marketing messages were a bad way to behave im hoping slop has the same impact  it can make it clear to people that generating and publishing unreviewed aigenerated content is bad behaviour slop is most obviously harmful when it is just plain wrong willison pointed to an aigenerated microsoft travel article that listed the ottawa food bank as a mustsee attraction in the canadian capital as a perfect example of the problem occasionally a piece of slop is so useless that it goes viral in its own right like the careers advice article that earnestly explains the punchline to a decadesold newspaper comic they pay me in woims while the precise meaning of they pay me in woims remains ambiguous various interpretations have emerged ranging from a playful comment on worklife balance to a deeper exploration of our perceived reality the slop begins aigenerated books have become a problem too a prominent example came when amateur mushroom pickers were recently warned to avoid foraging books sold on amazon that appeared to have been written by chatbots and contained dangerous advice for anyone hoping to discern a lethal fungus from an edible one

an advert was aigenerated rubbish when it was not he says adding that it could become a problem for the social media industry if consumers start to feel they are being served rubbish all the time tackling spam in inboxes required an enormous crossindustry effort and led to a fundamental change in the nature of email big webmail providers like gmail aggressively monitor their own platforms to crack down on spammers and are increasingly suspicious of emails arriving from untrusted email servers they also apply complex largely undocumented ai systems to try to detect spam directly in a

recently while working on a project at work we came to this architectural choice of whether to use api gateway as the interface of a backend service back the service behind a load balancer or maybe have the api gateway route the requests to the load balancer fronting the service while debating about these architectural choices with my peers i realized this is a problem many software development engineers would face while designing solutions in their domain this article will hopefully simplify these concepts and help choose the one that works the best based on individual use cases please understand the requirements or the problem you are working on first as the choice you make will be highly dependent on the use cases or requirements you have lets understand what an api is first an api is how two actors of software systems software components or users communicate with each other this communication happens through a defined set of interfaces and protocols eg the weather bureaus software system contains daily weather data the weather app on your phone talks to this system via apis and shows you daily weather updates on your phone an api gateway is a component of the appdelivery infrastructure that sits between clients and services and provides centralized handling of api communication between them in very simplistic terms api gateway is the gateway to the api it is the channel that helps users of the apis communicate with the apis while abstracting out complex details of the apis eg services they are in access control authentication and authorization security preventing ddos attacks etc imagine it being the switchboard operator of the manual telephone exchange whom users can call and ask to be connected with a specific number analogous to the software component here  image credits lets discuss the pros and cons of api gateway a little load balancing is the technique of distributing load between multiple backend servers based on their capacity and actual requests pattern todays applications can have requests incoming at a higher rate read hundreds or thousands of requestssecond asking backend services to perform actions eg data processing data fetching etc this requires services to be hosted on multiple servers at once this thus means we need a layer sitting on top of these backend servers load balancer which could route incoming requests to these servers based on what they can handle efficiently while keeping customer experience and service performance intact the load balancers also ensure that no one server is overworked as that could lead to requests failing or getting higher latencies on a very high level the load balancer does the following image credits lets come to the crux of the article now when do we use a load balancer for a service and when do we use an api gateway for it going with the pros of api gateway mentioned above the following are the cases when api gateway is best suited opinions expressed by dzone contributors are their own,Computing
the traveling salesman problem tsp is one of the challenging problems in operations research basically tsp is about optimizing the route for the salesperson to efficiently visit the list of cities and return to the starting point although the problems premise is simple its computational complexity makes it a significant focus for both theoretical studies and practical implementations the primary challenge of the tsp stems from its combinatorial nature if a salesman visits n cities they must evaluate n12 possible routes due to the flexibility in choosing the starting point and reversing the route this factorial increase means that even a small number of cities results in a massive number of possible routes for instance with 20 cities the salesman must consider about 60 billion routes this phenomenon termed a combinatorial explosion makes brute force methods impractical for large datasets the branch and bound algorithm widely solves optimization problems like the traveling salesman problem it systematically evaluates all possible alternatives to find the optimal solution while simultaneously excluding large parts of the search space that are unlikely to produce the best solution in the context of tsp the problem can be visualized as a decision tree where each node represents a partial route taken by the salesperson the root of the tree is the starting city and each branch from a node represents a possible next city to visit extending the partial route for example a salesman starts in san francisco the root node represents san francisco from there the salesman might choose to visit seattle denver or las vegas next each forming a new branch in the decision tree at each node in the decision tree the algorithm calculates a lower bound on the possible cost of completing the route from that node this lower bound is an estimate of the minimum additional cost required to complete the tour starting from the partial route represented by the node for example if the salesman has already traveled from san francisco to seattle the algorithm calculates the least cost required to visit the remaining cities denver and las vegas and return back to san francisco this estimation helps in determining whether to explore further from the current node the algorithm extends the current node by generating its children where each child node represents a new partial route that includes one additional city not yet visited this step breaks the problem into smaller subproblems that can be explored independently continuing the example if the salesman has traveled from san francisco to seattle the next branching might include routes from seattle to denver or seattle to las vegas these new branches further extend the decision tree to optimize the search process the algorithm compares the lower bound of each node with the cost of the optimal solution found so far if the lower bound of a node is greater than or equal to the cost of the current optimal solution then that node and all its child nodes are pruned and not explored further this technique significantly reduces the number of nodes that need to be explored thereby narrowing down the search space for example suppose the current best solution has a cost of 25 if the lower bound calculated for the route san francisco  seattle  denver is 30 then this route and its extensions can be pruned because they cannot yield a better solution than 25 the algorithm continues to explore the remaining nodes those not pruned repeating the branching and bounding process it keeps track of the best solution found during the search when all nodes are either pruned or explored the best solution at that point is the optimal solution consider a simple tsp with four cities san francisco a seattle b denver c and las vegas d by systematically applying these steps the branch and bound method effectively narrows down the search space and finds the optimal solution without having to examine every possible route exhaustively this is particularly powerful for problems like tsp where the number of possible solutions grows factorially with the number of cities   while the branch and bound algorithm is a powerful tool it faces significant challenges when applied to the traveling salesman problem in the worstcase scenario the time complexity of the branch and bound algorithm is factorial denoted as on where n represents the number of cities the number of possible routes grows factorially with the number of cities for example with just four cities san francisco a seattle b denver c and las vegas d there are 4 24 possible routes to evaluate this number becomes unmanageable as the number of cities increases evaluating and pruning branches in the search tree requires significant computational resources as the number of cities increases the complexity and the time required to find the optimal solution will also increase bb relies on heuristic methods to estimate lower bounds for pruning nonpromising branches if these heuristics are not effective the algorithm may explore many unnecessary branches further increasing computational time to overcome the constraints of traditional methods recent progress in machine learning especially with graph neural networks gnns has presented a promising solution gnns leverage the intrinsic structure of graph data introducing innovative techniques that improve upon existing algorithms like the branch and bound bb method by using the representational capabilities of graphs gnns can effectively model complex relationships thereby enhancing computational efficiency and helping in more informed decisionmaking processes graph neural networks gnns can transform the tsp graph where cities are represented as nodes and distances as edges into highdimensional embeddings these embeddings effectively capture the complex relationships between cities offering a richer representation than traditional methods for instance for cities like san francisco seattle denver and las vegas gnns can generate embeddings that reflect both distances and the overall topology providing a more detailed state representation starting the bb algorithm with nearly optimal heuristic solutions can significantly speed up the process gnns can predict these initial solutions by using learned embeddings to estimate more accurate starting points or bounds for example a gnn trained on numerous tsp instances may learn that starting a route from san francisco to denver might be more efficient than other initial routes even if raw distance data suggests otherwise choosing promising branches in the bb process is vital for efficiency gnns help by providing embeddings that predict the potential success of branching decisions focusing on more likely optimal branches and reducing the search space for example embeddings might indicate that a branch from seattle to denver holds more promise due to better intermediary connections or lower overall distance than a branch from seattle to las vegas this allows the bb algorithm to prioritize more strategic routes gnns refine the bounding process in bb by generating accurate heuristic estimates enabling tighter and more effective bounds for a partial route from san francisco to seattle a gnn can provide a sophisticated estimate of the lower bound for completing the tour this bound is based on an intricate understanding of the entire networks topology and distances allowing the bb algorithm to discard nonoptimal paths more effectively  combining gnns with reinforcement learning rl can further improve the decisionmaking process in the bb algorithm rl can dynamically adjust strategies for exploring and pruning branches based on realtime feedback leading to even more efficient solutions over time rl agents can learn from past experiences and enhance their strategies adapting to different instances of tsp and other optimization problems integrating graph neural networks gnns with the branch  bound bb algorithm represents a significant advancement in solving the traveling salesman problem tsp this hybrid approach effectively addresses the scalability and efficiency limitations of traditional methods paving the way for tackling various complex combinatorial challenges as research continues the synergy between gnns bb and other cuttingedge optimization techniques is expected to yield robust solutions for increasingly intricate and dynamic problems fostering innovative applications across diverse fields opinions expressed by dzone contributors are their

data lineage first it very much depends on the user organizations current use cases and their level of maturity in my humble opinion data engineers love looking at data flows and have that visual understanding of dependencies but do they really use data lineage at the end of the day what is the usage frequency what are the specific use cases from what we observed data lineage certainly drives interest however when it comes to actual usage it is not the central feature this could be because our implementation is limited to some data sources however having lineage limited to only some pipelines also seems less meaningful to me ie lineage in dbt or dataform as ingestion and other processes are left in shades a typical use case might involve someone in the organization searching for a specific pipeline or model about twice a week for a few minutes the most common use cases for lineage we saw were these are the times when lineage becomes very handy basically its when the company starts not just maintaining what is in their data warehouse or data lake but actually building and modernizing the data ecosystem does this mean that having lineage is a must in this case absolutely not but if you are interested in moving faster and smarter then the answer is absolutely yes so it very much depends on what the organization is currently doing i am not trying to be assertive here but rather intelligently honest by asking if you really need data lineage you might want to start with questions like then you speak to the universe and decide buy or build theres a lot to consider here my take is as follows ultimately my personal belief is that data lineage as a standalone visualization is not effective our use case for data lineage is to help troubleshoot broken pipelines or model errors because when organizations have an active warehouse with hundreds of pipelines and thousands of tables it is impossible to keep track of if everything is working as expected when we are talking about data quality those are sql rules and something already anticipated and known but pipelines and models are a different beast it is a lot about connectivity compatibility and effectiveness of the data platforms pairing data pipelinemodel error detection and data lineage is the area where we see a lot of response and value for users additionally it helps our clients save money as it is also connected to cost insights having lineage alone does not solve the problem it creates a new one no one understands how the solution is being used because lineage alone does not move the needle it rather helps to move it faster in combination with anomaly detection and pipeline error detection while data lineage alone may be seen as just another shining tool its true value emerges when paired with comprehensive monitoring mechanisms and a commitment from the organization and the data team to build up a robust and reliable data platform opinions expressed by dzone contributors are their own,Computing

vigile hoareau is a musician cognitive psychologist and computer programmer jimmy thomas is a multiplatinum rap producer who has worked with tupac and motown records together they are the founders of crowdaa a french company that allows nondevelopers to easily create and release apps on mobile the two were introduced eight years ago and bonded over their desire to give creatives especially the rising class of content creators more control over their platforms at the time hoareau had already launched a prototype of crowdaa in runion the french island territory he is from we shared the same vision about what should be the role and contribution of tech for content creators and communities he said at first hoareau and thomas built a product focused on music but pivoted during the pandemic to be a service for everyone using crowdaa professional communities and entertainment communities can publish their apps on the stores in a few clicks hoareau told techcrunch they own the data the content the users they decide how they monetize if so the company announced on thursday an improved update with new features including automating how users build deploy and submit their apps to the apple store and google play after an app is ready and a developer account has been set up an app is available on apples testflight within 20 minutes crowdaa said the goal is to help make app building easier which can help open new markets the company says it stands out from competitors because it lets people create apps without extensive development resource tools with vertically integrated solutions we do something very specific but we do it all the way up hoareau said the apps ambitions are catching investor attention too crowdaa recently announced a 12 million seed round led by apicap sports teams organizations and political parties are using crowdaa to create their apps and better engage with consumers the company says the power is in the technology behind the platform a fullstack service an easy draganddrop interface and integrated tools to help with legal and compliance hoareau said the fundraising process was pretty hard and spoke about how challenging it is being a founder from runion since mainland investors in france tend to pay little attention to the territories he and thomas had to dedicate time to building relationships and expanding their networks which they could tap into in addition to entering accelerators like the nvidia inception program that helped the company stay afloat other investors in the round include tremplin capital and teampact ventures crowdaa will use the recent fundraise to expand sales and marketing augment its presence in france and plan a us launch which it hopes to do in the next few weeks its also building out an ai chatbox

google is preparing to build what will be the first subsea fiberoptic cable connecting the continents of africa and australia the news comes as the major cloud hyperscalers battle it out for business dollars with google playing catchup with aws and microsofts azure googles announcement follows widespread outages across africa which have been attributed to faulty undersea cables and for a company that relies on resilient connectivity to deliver its services to consumers and businesses alike googles clearly trying to capitalize on this to position itself as the solution dubbed umoja its new cable starts off in kenya and runs through various countries including the democratic republic of the congo rwanda uganda zambia and zimbabwe before concluding its land journey in south africa  notably home to googles first african data center region which has been operational in johannesburg since the start of this year the terrestrial part of the route is actually already complete google confirmed to techcrunch which said it worked with a company called liquid intelligent technologies for that segment the work on channeling the cable across the indian ocean to perth australia is now underway  with no confirmed timeline for completion umoja will enable african countries to more reliably connect with each other and the rest of the world brian quigley google clouds vp for global network infrastructure said in a blog post thursday establishing a new route distinct from existing connectivity routes is critical to maintaining a resilient network for a region that has historically experienced highimpact outages there are hundreds of cables spanning the worlds seas oceans and waterways with big tech  including amazon google meta and microsoft  claiming an increasingly greater stake in the infrastructure the reason is simple the more cables and data centers there are the better quality of service they can provide to their customers be it lowerlatency youtube streams or speedier data transfers for enterprises built on cloud computing the current closest subsea cable route to googles planned route for umoja is subcos oman australia cable oac which opened for business in 2022  connecting oman with perth google has also already invested in various cabling projects centered around africa including equiano which connects portugal with nigeria and south africa earlier this year the company also announced plans to build what will be one of the first subsea cables connecting south america with asiapacific running from chile to australia via french polynesia while google hasnt provided a specific timeframe for completing umoja a spokesperson told techcrunch that a typical submarine cable build from planning to becoming operational takes

we are in a climate crisis and technology can be either a part of the problem or a force for good says greenpeace cto priscilla chombakinywa according to the international panel on climate change she explains we have less than seven years before earth becomes really difficult to live on last year alone the world witnessed wildfires in north america floods in southern africa and even the double tragedy of floods and fires in places like greece she says social media allows people from across the world to communicate but were seeing misinformation disinformation and a wanton disregard for sustainability by some of these platformsand unfortunately people dont have many other options chombakinywa says that vcs startups investors and technologists should invest in alternative platforms that are green that are ethical that are valuebased and that give us an alternative to what we have right now being built by people so passionate about the environment that they will not sell out in the name of profits even though conventional investment is supposed to maximize shareholder value she argues investing in these platforms is a price worth paying as customers will soon be demanding action chombakinywa salutes companies already taking actionsuch as hyundai which recently committed to stop supplying the heavy machinery used for illegal mining in the amazon this was possible she says through the use of satellite imagery and pressure from leaders in indigenous communities which led to a report that hyundai couldnt ignore good data she explains is vitalgreenpeace has been using it since 2009 to persuade some tech giants to switch to 100 percent renewable energy for those that refused the campaigning ngo just walked away other organizations should do the same she says what if you could use your influence to apply pressure on these organizations to change she asks say weve looked at the data weve looked at your plans youre not doing enough and we wont give you our money then maybe we can make a little bit more of a change finally she says businesses need to work with communities from places like senegal zambia nigeria bangladesh and mexico to understand and support their movements sit with the elders in their communities listen to the indigenous knowledge that allowed them to coexist with nature and start to reapply some of those principles she suggests they are scrambling for their lives chombakinywa also says that conversations on ai need to focus on the planet were talking about values ethics and putting guardrails in placebut we cant do that without talking about the environment she argues we need to think through the environmental cost of ai it has the potential to help us solve some of humanitys grand challenges but thats only useful if humanity has a livable planet this article appears in the marchapril 2024 issue of wired uk magazine by carlton reid by emily mullin by steven levy by andy greenberg,Computing

researchers have created fibrebased electronics that use the human body to power tshirts that display changing messages whether it is a tshirt that can display changing messages or a carpet that can sense where you are standing the future of smart textiles has often seemed rooted in science fiction now researchers say they have created smart fibres that can do exactly those things  and they do not even require a battery pack researchers in china say they have created fibrebased electronics that harness electromagnetic energy in the atmosphere using the human body as part of the circuit this makes a bodycoupled fibre electronic technology that does not need electronic chips or batteries to work and which the team say could be used for a host of applications when electromagnetic energy travels through the fibre it is converted by fibres into other forms of energy including visible light and radio waves so in addition to emitting light the fibre emits electric signals when touched by a human body said chengyi hou a coauthor of the research from donghua university shanghai by controlling various aspects of the system such as the area of fibre in contact with the body or the diameter of the fibres these wireless signals can be programmed hou added these wireless signals can be conveniently picked up with a coil and then wireless signals with different characteristics will be translated by electronic devices into different commands he said noting that could mean turning the device on or off or other actions the team say the approach removes a key challenge faced when attempting to incorporate electronic systems into textiles the need for rigid components we have already achieved mass production of this new type of fibre electronics which is as fine and soft as traditional fibres so the next step is to apply it to textiles we use every day such as cloths towels carpets and so on said hou among the prototypes developed by the team is a wearable fabric display coupled to a fabric keyboard  which the team say could be used by people who have a hearing impairment to help them communicate with others  and textile controllers for video games they also created a wireless haptic carpet that glows underfoot which not only provides a form of emergency lighting at night but can also wirelessly transmit signals that can be used to control switches on appliances in the home such as lights writing in the journal science the team said that the fibres are composed of three layers made from lowcost raw materials and are durable washable and sweatresistant writing in an accompanying article yunzhu li from the university of illinois urbanachampaign and yiyue luo from mit suggest such technology could also have applications in robots and robotic prosthetics as well as offer a way to gather tactile information to better understand interactions between humans and the objects around them dr luigi occhipinti director of research in smart electronics biosystems and ai at the university of cambridge also said the approach has potential as we are constantly in the proximity of sources of electromagnetic fields of various nature and with different characteristics developing new classes of etextiles that incorporate skin sensors and nontraditional electronics powered uniquely via fibrebased energy harvesters in contact with our body could unleash an entirely new class of selfpowered wearable electronics for continuous monitoring of personal health he said,Computing
in 2021 the web felt dead because algorithms were driving people to act like robots now the robots are posting like people dont get techscape delivered to your inbox sign up for the full article here i know im real and you dear reader know youre real but do you ever suspect that everyone else on the internet is acting strange that the spaces you used to frequent feel a bit  dead you arent alone dead internet theory first hit the web almost three years ago propelled to the mainstream by an essay in the atlantic by kaitlyn tiffany deadinternet theory suggests that the internet has been almost entirely taken over by artificial intelligence like lots of other online conspiracy theories the audience for this one is growing because of discussion led by a mix of true believers sarcastic trolls and idly curious lovers of chitchat  but unlike lots of other online conspiracy theories this one has a morsel of truth to it person or bot does it really matter at the time it was writing the deadest part of the internet was twitter in its moribund premusk years the sites aggressive curation served up the same relatable content to hundreds of thousands of users who made tweaks to posts like i hate texting come over and cuddle me and then reposted them the distinction between person and bot was also being blurred by a recommendation algorithm that drove people to act like bots beyond that central idea the 2021 version of the conspiracy theory took some weird turns one proponent tiffany wrote suggests that the internet died in 2016 or early 2017 and that now it is empty and devoid of people as well as entirely sterile as evidence illuminatipirate offers ive seen the same threads the same pics and the same replies reposted over and over across the years the theory wasnt wrong  it was just too soon talking about a dead internet the summer before the release of chatgpt is like the guardian colleague who confidently declared in the summer of 2016 its been a mad rush of political news since the 2014 local elections so its weird to think that theres just brexit and the us election and then everything will be quiet for the next few years in 2021 the internet felt dead because aggressive algorithmic curation was driving people to act like robots in 2024 the opposite has happened the robots are posting like people here are just a few examples on twitter itself after musk rescued the site from the frying pan and tossed it in a volcano an illconceived monetisation scheme has made it profitable to buy a blue checkmark attach it to a large language model and set it

lowstakes allbot battle royale death permeates google the top of its search results is a valuable position  so valuable that businesses competing to be there have no spare money to actually write their articles no problem chatgpt can churn something out in a second of course thats only valuable if the resultant visitors are humans who you can make money from bad news because   across the web bots account for around half of all internet traffic according to research from cybersecurity firm imperva almost onethird of all traffic is what the company calls bad bots doing anything from ad fraud to brute force hacking attacks but even the good bots are struggling to earn that categorisation googles crawler was a welcome sight when it was updating your search entry but less so when it was simply training an ai to repeat what you wrote without sending any users over and then theres crab jesus an unholy marriage of facebook content farms aigenerated imagery and automated testing to work out what goes the most viral led to weeks of viral content featuring combinations of jesus crustaceans and female flight attendants in one such image jesus was pictured eating shellfish wearing a jacket made of prawns more confusing was the image of a sort of crabcentaur saviour walking along a beach arminarm with what appears to be the entire crew from a longhaul flight it was at least interestingly bizarre  a step up from the previous viral chum of the 122yearold woman posing in front of her homemade birthday cake i want to provide a ray of hope here a nice little tip for how to insert some vitality into the internet again but i cant it really does feel as if the publicfacing net is in the latter stages of a zombie apocalypse the good news is that there are safe havens private social like whatsapp and discord servers can hide from the onslaught in secrecy while smaller communities such as bluesky and mastodon are safe through obscurity for now in the midterm i expect to see large platforms cotton on to the wasteland their services have become and use a combination of account verification and ai detection to try and restore some humanity to their offerings whether it will be too late by then though is an open question there is at least one human still on the internet elon musk who is so addicted to posting that he spent 44bn to be called an idiot on a platform he owns so his latest legal defeat will have hit him where it hurts after the us supreme court declined to take up his plea to be freed from a courtappointed posting babysitter from our story sign up to techscape alex herns weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion the supreme court on monday rejected an appeal from elon musk over a settlement with securities regulators that requires him to get approval in advance of some tweets that relate to tesla the electric vehicle company he leads the justices did not comment in leaving in place lowercourt rulings against musk who complained that the requirement amounts to prior restraint on his speech in violation of the first amendment the ruling comes a day after he made an unannounced visit to china aimed at sealing a deal to roll out teslas driver assistance features there for those without an encyclopaedic memory of all things elon in 2018 musk tweeted that he had funding secured to take tesla private the company never went private and in ensuing lawsuits it turned out that he had at best a few discussions about it to put an end to the legislation musk agreed to resign as tesla chairman pay 20m and have an inhouse lawyer preapprove all his social media posts about the electric carmaker hes regretted it ever since battling to have that part of the agreement which he entered in to voluntarily to avoid a damaging court case overturned the preapproval provision at issue continues to cast an unconstitutional chill over mr musks speech whenever he considers making public communications his lawyers argued well the supreme court in the us doesnt care it didnt take his case implicitly determining that no real constitutional issue is at stake the weird thing is that the inhouse lawyer already seems to be taking a very handsoff approach to musks posts on friday he responded to an allegation from early facebook employee dustin moskovitz that tesla was the next enron by

steven anderegg allegedly used the stable diffusion ai model to generate photos if convicted he could face up to 70 years in prison the fbi has charged a us man with creating more than 10000 sexually explicit and abusive images of children which he allegedly generated using a popular artificial intelligence tool authorities also accused the man 42yearold steven anderegg of sending pornographic aimade images to a 15yearold boy over instagram anderegg crafted about 13000 hyperrealistic images of nude and semiclothed prepubescent children prosecutors stated in an indictment released on monday often images depicting children touching their genitals or being sexually abused by adult men evidence from the wisconsin mans laptop allegedly showed he used the popular stable diffusion ai model which turns text descriptions into images andereggs charges came after the national center for missing  exploited children ncmec received two reports last year that flagged his instagram account which prompted law enforcement officials to monitor his activity on the social network obtain information from instagram and eventually obtain a search warrant authorities seized his laptop and found thousands of generative ai images according to the indictment against him as well as a history of using extremely specific and explicit prompts to create abusive material anderegg faces four counts of creating distributing and possessing child sexual abuse material and sending explicit material to a child under 16 if convicted he faces a maximum sentence of about 70 years in prison with 404 media

ai could lead to a surge in child sexual abuse material reports of online child abuse to the ncmec rose about 12 in 2023 from the previous year in part due to a sharp increase in aimade material threatening to overwhelm the organizations tip line for flagging potential child sexual abuse material csam the ncmec is deeply concerned about this quickly growing trend as bad actors can use artificial intelligence to create deepfaked sexually explicit images or videos based on any photograph of a real child or generate csam depicting computergenerated children engaged in graphic sexual acts the ncmecs report read the boom in generative ai has led to the widespread creation of nonconsensual deepfake pornography which has targeted anyone from alist celebrities to average private citizens aigenerated images and deepfakes of minors have also circulated among schools in one case leading to the arrest of two middle school boys in florida who created nude images of their classmates several states have passed laws against the nonconsensual generation of explicit images while the department of justice has said that generating sexual ai images of children is illegal the justice department will aggressively pursue those who produce and distribute child sexual abuse material  or csam  no matter how that material was created the deputy attorney general lisa monaco said in a statement after the arrest put simply csam generated by ai is still csam and we will hold accountable those who exploit ai to create obscene abusive and increasingly photorealistic images of children stable diffusion which is an opensource artificial intelligence model has previously been used to generate sexually abusive images and modified by users to produce explicit material a report last year from the stanford internet observatory also found that there was child sexual abuse material in its training data stability ai which created stable diffusion has said it forbids the use of

exclusive ads containing aimanipulated images were submitted to facebook by civil and corporate accountability groups the facebook and instagram owner meta approved a series of aimanipulated political adverts during indias election that spread disinformation and incited religious violence according to a report shared exclusively with the guardian facebook approved adverts containing known slurs towards muslims in india such as lets burn this vermin and hindu blood is spilling these invaders must be burned as well as hindu supremacist language and disinformation about political leaders another approved advert called for the execution of an opposition leader they falsely claimed wanted to erase hindus from india next to a picture of a pakistan flag the adverts were created and submitted to metas ad library  the database of all adverts on facebook and instagram  by india civil watch international icwi and ek a corporate accountability organisation to test metas mechanisms for detecting and blocking political content that could prove inflammatory or harmful during indias sixweek election according to the report all of the adverts were created based upon real hate speech and disinformation prevalent in india underscoring the capacity of social media platforms to amplify existing harmful narratives the adverts were submitted midway through voting which began in april and would continue in phases until 1 june the election will decide if the prime minister narendra modi and his hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party bjp government will return to power for a third term during his decade in power modis government has pushed a hindufirst agenda which human rights groups activists and opponents say has led to the increased persecution and oppression of indias muslim minority in this election the bjp has been accused of using antimuslim rhetoric and stoking fears of attacks on hindus who make up 80 of the population to garner votes during a rally in rajasthan modi referred to muslims as infiltrators who have more children though he later denied this was directed at muslims and said he had many muslim friends the social media site x was recently ordered to remove a bjp campaign video accused of demonising muslims the report researchers submitted 22 adverts in english hindi bengali gujarati and kannada to meta of which 14 were approved a further three were approved after small tweaks were made that did not alter the overall provocative messaging after they were approved they were immediately removed by the researchers before publication metas systems failed to detect that all of the approved adverts featured aimanipulated images despite a public pledge by the company that it was dedicated to preventing aigenerated or manipulated content being spread on its platforms during the indian election five of the adverts were rejected for breaking metas community standards policy on hate speech and violence including one that featured misinformation about modi but the 14 that were approved which largely targeted muslims also broke metas own policies on hate speech bullying and harassment misinformation and violence and incitement according to the report maen hammad a campaigner at ek accused meta of profiting from the proliferation of hate speech supremacists racists and autocrats know they can use hypertargeted ads to spread vile hate speech share images of mosques burning and push violent conspiracy theories  and meta will gladly take their money no questions asked he said meta also failed to recognise the 14 approved adverts were political or electionrelated even though many took aim at political parties and candidates opposing the bjp under metas policies political adverts have to go through a specific authorisation process before approval but only three of the submissions were rejected on this basis this meant these adverts could freely violate indias election rules which stipulate all political advertising and political promotion is banned in the 48 hours before polling begins and during voting these adverts were all uploaded to coincide with two phases of election voting in response a meta spokesperson said people who wanted to run ads about elections or politics must go through the authorisation process required on our platforms and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws the company added when we find content including ads that violates our community standards or community guidelines we remove it regardless of its creation mechanism aigenerated content is also eligible to be reviewed and rated by our network of independent factcheckers  once a content is labeled as altered we reduce the contents distribution we also require advertisers globally to disclose when they use ai or digital methods to create or alter a political or social issue ad in certain cases a previous report by icwi and ek found that shadow advertisers aligned to political parties particularly the bjp have been paying vast sums to disseminate unauthorised political adverts on platforms during indias election many of these real adverts were found to endorse islamophobic tropes and hindu supremacist narratives meta denied most of these adverts violated their policies meta has previously been accused of failing to stop the spread of islamophobic hate speech calls to violence and antimuslim conspiracy theories on its platforms in india in some cases posts have led to reallife cases of riots and lynchings nick clegg metas president of global affairs recently described indias election as a huge huge test for us and said the company had done months and months and months of preparation in india meta said it had expanded its network of local and thirdparty factcheckers across all platforms and was working across 20 indian languages hammad said the reports findings had exposed the inadequacies of these mechanisms this election has shown once more that meta doesnt have a plan to address the landslide of hate speech and disinformation on its platform during these critical elections he said it cant even detect a handful of violent aigenerated images how can we trust them with dozens of other elections worldwide,Computing

a developers code changes may impact the softwares functionality even minor changes can have unanticipated consequences or result in the appearance of new bugs for example we use regression testing to detect newly discovered problems regression testing is the process of rerunning tests to ensure that code changes do not affect existing functionality there are times when there isnt enough time or resources to run regression tests a testing team can only examine the system modules modified they do not perform complete regression testing this is known as nonregression testing nonregression testing is a technique for determining whether a new or modified functionality works properly while assuming that the previous functionality was unaffected for example when using nonregression testing testers examine only the evolving unit or module rather than the entire product saving resources and time nonregression testing is a technique aimed at verifying whether a new or modified functionality operates correctly with the assumption that the previous functionality wasnt affected for example when applying nonregression testing testers check only the evolving unit or module instead of the whole product thus saving resources and time the nonregression testing goal is to see if any undesirable behavior emerges following the most recent software modifications there the new application behavior is previously known allowing the identification of an eventual regression bug exploratory testing on the other hand aims to discover how the software works balancing testing and learning and encouraging testers to create new test cases while regression testing aims to ensure that a software bug has been successfully corrected by retesting the modified software the goal of nonregression testing is to ensure that no new software bugs have been introduced after the software has been updated in general this disparity in definitions can be assumed to be based on the results of each test when a new software version is released with no new features compared to the previous version ie the differences between the two versions are limited to bug fixes or software optimization both releases are expected to have the same functionalities in this case the tests performed on both versions are not likely to produce different results but rather ensure that existing bugs have been fixed and no new bugs have been introduced this testing methodology distinguishes regression testing on the other hand if the new release includes new features or improvements that cause the software to behave differently the tests performed on the previous and new versions may yield the following results desired differences associated with expected new behavior and undesired differences indicate a software regression caused by a sideeffect bug a regression test is typically a test that we perform to ensure that the systems various functionalities are still working as expected and that the new functionalities added did not break any of the existing ones this could be a combination of apiuiunit tests run regularly nonregression tests can refer to various things depending on the context of your projects such as smoke testing or unit testing that are run during every code checkin it could also refer to storylevel testing carried out when a specific featurerequirement in a story is being tested security testing load testing and stress testing may also be performed during the development lifecycle nonparametric regression is a type of regression analysis in which the predictor does not take a predetermined form but is built based on data information that is no parametric form for the relationship between predictors and the dependent variable is assumed nonparametric regression necessitates larger sample sizes than parametric regression because the data must supply both the model structure and the model estimates nonregression testing can be incorporated into regression analysis heres a rundown of how it works for example assume there is an existing functionality a tested and a new functionality b that has just been added to the product so for the time being the program functionality is ab nonregression testing will only cover functionality b however a new functionality  c  will be added later if we want regression testing well need to run the tests for a and b functionality nonregression tests are incorporated into regression testing nonregression testing is used when system components evolve or new system components and functionality are added its goal is to ensure that the changes are correct and that no regression bugs have appeared in the system due to the recent evolution in general previous test sequences are launched to ensure that the systems testing quality has not deteriorated the test plan specifies the components to be tested following the evolution or modification of a system component regression testing is a multilayered process due to its extensive coverage and technical complexity heres a stepbystep guide to regression testing and incorporating automation into the workflow at this stage a developer estimates which system components will be changed and the extent of the change impact analysis of software changes this stage entails outlining all of the possible consequences of the code change across the system identifying all systems affected by a new fix or feature estimating potential system damage and ways to deal with it it is creating a strategy for regression testing the testing team outlines the workflow step by step at this stage for example a regression testing strategy might look something like this 1 collect test data 2 estimate execution time for test cases 3 automate test cases 4 execute tests 5 report and 6 iterate they are developing a test suite at this point a qa specialist creates automated tests later the regression when running automated tests on testing automation engineer writes scripts for execution in a scripted language selected by the team ahead of time running regression tests when running automated tests prioritize cases and evaluate test module reusability maintain a high frequency of testing and establish a flexible reporting system reporting at this point qa specialists must explain the testing results to stakeholders such as a project manager the end client and anyone who is involved in addition a developer must develop the metrics of analysis of the scope of testing and elaborate on how the testing session helped the team achieve a goal set during the planning stage to write a compelling summary report nonregression testing entails simply testing regression testing entails repeatedly testing the application in two scenarios when a defect is discovered by a tester and corrected by a developer the tester must focus on the defect functionality and related old functionality once the changes have been incorporated into the application the tester must test both the new and related old functionality to ensure that the related old functionality remains the same a tester always carries out nonregression testing if any defects are discovered then you must perform regression testing published at dzone with permission of yogesh solanki see the original article here opinions expressed by dzone contributors are their

as artificial intelligence ai continues to transform various aspects of business operations its potential to revolutionize it service management itsm is becoming increasingly evident ram ramamoorthy director of ai research at manageengine shared valuable insights on this topic during his keynote and then in a oneonone interview at the recent manageengine user conference when asked about the future of itsm applications ramamoorthy emphasized that ai will become deeply interlaced with enterprise software much like search functionality i see ai as not a standalone product i see it deeply interlaced with enterprise consumer and software tools that you use more so in the enterprise because you have a ton of observation and tracking data that you are able to analyze and make predictions with it he explained ramamoorthy predicts ai will enable a shift from process automation to decision automation where ai augments and accelerates decisionmaking however he believes that humanaugmented decisions will remain the norm for the next few years before fully autonomous decisionmaking becomes prevalent digital maturity is a moving target and organizations need to track key performance indicators kpis to ensure they are making progress according to ramamoorthy better digitization leads to greater ai impact he recommends moving under a single system leveraging machine learning to sift through data and focusing on the consumer experience ramamoorthy emphasizes the importance of process streamlining data streamlining and automation in achieving digital maturity process streamlining involves capturing and digitizing processes across the organization enabling seamless integration between departments and systems this is particularly crucial for it teams as they need to adapt to and leverage the increasing agility of infrastructure and application teams data streamlining is essential to make data accessible and usable for ai applications ramamoorthy suggests creating an analytics platform and a data lake to centralize data from various sources this enables organizations to break down data silos and gain a holistic view of their operations additionally leveraging lowcode extensibility allows for easier integration of data from different systems even when native integrations are not available automation is another key aspect of digital maturity by automating repetitive tasks and processes organizations can free up human resources to focus on highervalue activities ramamoorthy recommends investing in aipowered automation tools that can learn from historical data and improve decisionmaking over time data silos are a common challenge hindering ai initiatives to overcome this ramamoorthy advises organizations to use lowcode extensibility to integrate and aggregate more data from more sources this approach enables organizations to connect disparate systems and create a unified data platform to get the most value from their data when it comes to selecting ai models organizations must strike a balance between prebuilt and custom models prebuilt models can provide a quick start and are suitable for general use cases such as natural language processing nlp and search functionality however for more specific and complex use cases custom models may be necessary to address unique business requirements ramamoorthy emphasizes that customization can be expensive and organizations should carefully evaluate the costs and benefits before embarking on custom model development he also stresses the importance of integrating ai with existing it service providers rather than treating it as a standalone solution this approach ensures that ai is seamlessly embedded into the organizations it ecosystem enabling better decisionmaking and improved service delivery to further streamline ai adoption ramamoorthy recommends collaborating closely with it service providers who have deep expertise in ai and can guide organizations through the process of model selection deployment and integration by leveraging the knowledge and experience of these providers organizations can accelerate their ai initiatives and avoid common pitfalls implementing ai in it operations comes with its own set of challenges ramamoorthy cautions against setting moonshot expectations and viewing ai as a silver bullet begin with small projects that can be successful doing so enables companies to train employees on how to use ai effectively and keep decisions in check while gaining practical experience capturing and sharing learnings from incidents is crucial this promotes collaboration which is critical for the success of ai initiatives ramamoorthy suggests using service desk tools annotation and internal social platforms like zoho connect to facilitate knowledge sharing across the organization as ai becomes more prevalent in it operations the role of it teams will evolve ramamoorthy advises professionals to keep realistic expectations and develop skills in humanaugmented decisionmaking he also highlights the importance of understanding confidence intervals and leveraging autonomous decisionmaking for highconfidence scenarios for organizations starting their ai journey ramamoorthy recommends focusing on natural language processing nlp and humangenerated language as quick win use cases replacing traditional search functionality with aipowered search can deliver immediate benefits without extensive training this delivers huge benefits to employees and customers alike as ai becomes increasingly integrated into it service management and decisionmaking processes ensuring its trustworthiness explainability and fairness is paramount ramamoorthy emphasizes the importance of treating data like code to maintain the integrity and reliability of ai systems treating data like code involves implementing robust access controls and security measures to protect sensitive information this includes enforcing strict authentication protocols such as twofactor authentication to prevent unauthorized access to data by treating data with the same level of security as code organizations can minimize the risk of data breaches and ensure that only authorized personnel can access and manipulate the data used to train ai models access controls also play a crucial role in maintaining data privacy and compliance with regulations such as gdpr and hipaa by implementing granular access controls organizations can ensure that sensitive data is only accessible to those who need it for specific purposes reducing the risk of data misuse or leakage in addition to access controls ramamoorthy stresses the importance of conducting bias checks to ensure that ai models are fair and unbiased bias can creep into ai systems through various means such as biased training data flawed algorithms or human prejudices if left unchecked biased ai can lead to discriminatory decisions and perpetuate societal inequalities to mitigate bias organizations should regularly audit their ai models and training data for potential biases this involves analyzing the data for underrepresentation or overrepresentation of certain groups as well as testing the models outputs for fairness and consistency across different demographics bias checks should be conducted at various stages of the ai lifecycle from data collection and preprocessing to model training and deployment ramamoorthy specifically highlights the importance of bias checks in sensitive areas like service desk ticket prioritization in this context biased ai could lead to unfair treatment of certain users or customers based on factors such as their name location or communication style by conducting regular bias checks and ensuring that ticket prioritization algorithms are fair and objective organizations can provide equitable service to all users and maintain trust in their it service management processes explainability is another crucial aspect of trustworthy ai explainable ai refers to the ability to understand and interpret how an ai model arrives at its decisions this is particularly important in highstakes scenarios where aidriven decisions can have significant consequences such as in it security or incident response to ensure explainability organizations should prioritize the use of interpretable ai models such as decision trees or rulebased systems over blackbox models like deep neural networks interpretable models allow it teams to trace the logic behind aidriven decisions and identify potential errors or biases in cases where complex models are necessary organizations should invest in tools and techniques for explainable ai such as feature importance analysis or counterfactual explanations by prioritizing trustworthiness fairness and explainability in their ai initiatives organizations can build confidence in their aidriven it service management processes this trust is essential for driving adoption and realizing the full potential of ai in improving service delivery reducing costs and enhancing user experiences moreover trustworthy and unbiased ai is not only an ethical imperative but also a legal and regulatory requirement in many jurisdictions as ai governance frameworks and regulations evolve organizations that prioritize responsible ai practices will be better positioned to comply with these requirements and maintain public trust in their services treating data like code implementing robust access controls conducting regular bias checks and ensuring explainability are essential components of building trustworthy and unbiased ai systems by prioritizing these practices organizations can harness the power of ai to transform their it service management processes while ensuring fairness accountability and transparency looking ahead ramamoorthy is excited about the potential of combining different ai models to solve complex problems for example using computer vision to read pdfs understanding user

the development of aitocode projects is becoming more and more evolved but how will that affect the role of a software developer software developers will inevitably confront hurdles as artificial intelligence ai begins to permeate practically every area of our daily and professional lives ais coding prowess is not only revolutionizing software development processes but also fundamentally altering the roles that software professionals play in the software sector rather than viewing this evolution as a threat to employment software engineers roles will simply evolve they will adjust to make use of new instruments and technologies necessitating a shift in knowledge and methods for project management and creativity in order to make sense of the current changes it is helpful to take a glance back software development has always been a very humancentered endeavor encouraging more people to learn and use computer languages has always been the aim of programming from the earliest days of simple machine code to the present programming took a lot of time and required a deep understanding of how hardware and software interacted throughout the 1950s and 60s technology progressed over time from one of the first database languages sql to the more recent mongodb as the technologies developed over time they gave rise to more abstract languages that let programmers concentrate less on the intricate details of coding and more on solving problems with the advancement of tools and languages over time teamwork and communication were completely transformed by ideas like objectoriented programming and later software development approaches like agile and devops developers were able to produce software solutions with higher quality and productivity because of each of these advancements ai technology is already starting to find its way into the programming community through cuttingedge platforms and tools that optimize and automate various software development processes developers can add comments and code fragments to produce realtime code suggestions using tools like github copilot which is based on openais codex and other intelligent code assistants large code sample databases are used by these systems to learn from and they frequently provide full features or solutions that cut down on coding effort and greatly increase developer productivity however ais benefits go beyond just making coding faster it could fundamentally alter the definition of what it means to be a developer for instance ai enables developers to assign more monotonous or routine programming work to ai systems freeing them up to concentrate on more intricate imaginative or strategic project elements it takes more knowledge of software architecture usability and system integration to make the transition from code craftsman to code architect a critical viewpoint on this evolution meanwhile also draws attention to some dangers when ai is used exclusively in the development process it can dilute the foundational programming knowledge of more junior developers who might never learn to code on their own this might produce a generation of engineers who know how to use technologies well but dont grasp the fundamental ideas behind software development furthermore as more and more code is produced by algorithms whose decisionmaking procedures can be opaque it calls into question the stability and security of software the increasing use of ai in software development is causing a paradigm shift in the jobs of developers developers are evolving from being merely code writers to orchestrators of technology strategists and leaders of innovation this calls for adjusting to new roles that prioritize higherlevel decisionmaking problem characterization and system design one of the changes involves that the developers need to be skilled in incorporating and tailoring ai tools into their workflow this entails knowing the possibilities and limitations of these instruments in addition to being able to use them developers can devote their time to more complicated and valuable operations by becoming proficient with these technologies and freeing up time from repetitive jobs as ai assumes greater responsibility for the technical coding process soft skills like project management communication and creative problemsolving become more crucial developers need to be multidisciplinary collaborators proficient communicators with nontechnical team members and project managers of both people and technology furthermore as ai has the potential to impact software development there is an increased need to think about the technologys ethical ramifications when using ai developers need to be able to assess it critically and make sure that privacy security and justice are prioritized it is evident from these shifts in employment roles and necessary skills that although ai may alter the software development industry in the future developers themselves are not inherently in danger rather it should be viewed as a chance to advance into new positions requiring a combination of leadership abilities strategic acumen and technical proficiency in the future there will likely be more complex interactions between developers and ai the role of the developer does not change even though ai technologies can undertake more complex tasks as they get more sophisticated rather it highlights how important it is for developers to change and advance with the technologies the application of artificial intelligence ai to predictive development presents an intriguing opportunity this approach leverages data analysis and trends to predict future requirements and issues in addition to helping with coding this might greatly shorten the time needed for development and improve process efficiency even with ais breakthroughs human oversight will always be necessary it will be the responsibility of developers to guarantee that ai systems make morally righteous equitable and userfriendly decisions this entails evaluating the viability and usefulness of aigenerated solutions as well as looking for biases in ai outputs additionally developers will have more time to focus on creative areas of software development such as ux design interactive components and innovative application functionality as ai takes on more mundane coding jobs this change may result in software solutions that are better tailored to the needs of the user and offer up new markets for creative applications the concern that software developers will be replaced by ai should not be prominent for developers yet developers should embrace ai as a potent tool that can improve their skills automate tedious chores and free up time for more creative and complicated work rather than fearing it the software development industry is changing due to ai integration not because developers are becoming less relevant rather their responsibilities are becoming more varied and they are undergoing change as we advance the collaboration between artificial intelligence and human developers will be crucial to opening up new possibilities in software development and ensuring that creativity and technology coexist peacefully opinions expressed by dzone contributors are their own,Computing
if your system is facing an imminent security threator worse youve just suffered a breachthen logs are your goto if youre a security engineer working closely with developers and the devops team you already know that you depend on logs for threat investigation and incident response logs offer a detailed account of system activities analyzing those logs helps you fortify your digital defenses against emerging risks before they escalate into fullblown incidents at the same time your logs are your digital footprints vital for compliance and auditing your logs contain a massive amount of data about your systems and hence your security and that leads to some serious questions recently ive been trying to use tools and services to get a handle on my logs in this post ill look at some best practices for using these toolshow they can help with security and identifying threats and finally ill look at how artificial intelligence may play a role in your log analysis logs are essential for the early identification of security threats heres how logs are a gold mine of streaming realtime analytics and crucial information that your team can use to its advantage with dashboards visualizations metrics and alerts set up to monitor your logs you can effectively identify and mitigate threats in practice ive used both sumo logic and the elk stack a combination of elasticsearch kibana beats and logstash these tools can help your security practice by allowing you to  using a sumo logic dashboard of logs metrics and traces to track down security threats its also best practice to set up alerts to see issues early giving you the lead time needed to deal with any threat the best tools are also infrastructure agnostic and can be run on any number of hosting environments logs help you with more than just looking into the past to figure out what happened they also help you prepare for the future insights from log data can help your team craft its security strategies for the future so we know we need to use logs to identify threats both present and future but to be the most effective what should we log the short answer iseverything you want to capture everything you can all the time when youre first getting started it may be tempting to try to triage logs guessing as to what is important to keep and what isnt but logging all events as they happen and putting them in the right repository for analysis later is often your best bet in terms of log data more is almost always better but of course this presents challenges when you retain all those logs it can be very expensive and its stressful to think about how much money it will cost to store all of this data when you just throw it in an s3 bucket for review later for example on aws a daily log data ingest of 100gbday with the elk stack could create an annual cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars this often leads to developers selfselecting what they think is  and isnt  important to log your first option is to be smart and proactive in managing your logs this can work for tools such as the elk stack as long as you follow some basic rules these are great steps but unfortunately they can involve a lot of work and a lot of guesswork you often dont know what you need from the logs until after the fact a second option is to use a tool or service that offers flatrate pricing for example sumo logics 0 ingest with this type of service you can stream all of your logs without worrying about overwhelming ingest costs instead of a pergbingested type of billing this plan bills based on the valuable analytics and insights you derive from that data you can log everything and pay just for what you need to get out of your logs in other words you are free to log it all the right tool or service of course can help you make sense of all this data and the best of these tools work pretty well the obvious new tool to help you make sense of all this data is ai with data that is formatted predictably we can apply classification algorithms and other machinelearning techniques to find out exactly what we want to know about our application ai can ai probably isnt coming for your job but it will probably make your job a whole lot easier log data is one of the most valuable and available means to ensure your applications security and operations it can help guard against both current and future attacks and for log data to be of the most use you should log as much information as you can the last problem you want during a security crisis is to find out you didnt log the information you need opinions expressed by dzone contributors are their own,Computing
software architecture defines the blueprint or the structure in which software components are organized in a software system it also suggests the relationship between various software components and how they communicate with each other software architecture patterns are general reusable software blueprints that could be used for specific software engineering problems given specific context there are various types of software architectural patterns in this document we will cover a few which are used most frequently with their advantages and disadvantages a monolith architecture is the traditional blueprint of software in which all the components are coupled within one component itself generally within the same code base eg an ecommerce java web application contained within a war file deployed on a web container containing everything from ui to backend apis for all use cases eg inventory management user profile management order management etc including database interactions monolith architecture can prove to be a useful software architecture for software systems very early in their life cycle as it minimizes overload by reducing the time required in code management deployment etc microservices architecture is the blueprint in which a software system has independent loosely coupled services these services could have their own interfaces databases and infrastructures these could be updated tested and deployed independently every service in this architecture pattern can scale up or down based on its own needs it could appear that microservices architecture makes the service organization more complex by bringing in more movable components however its not the case microservices architecture makes the complexity of a system more manageable by breaking down components into smaller manageable components which can function independently while not impacting other components by adhering to a defined contract this architecture pattern organizes software components into horizontal layers with each layer playing a specific role in the software system eg an ecommerce software system containing four layers in its software stack  database persistence business and presentation each layer consists of software components that perform related functionality eg persistence layer will work as the software ingress and outgress for actions requiring interaction with the database this architecture pattern details systems reacting to an outside event software systems in this architecture pattern interact with each other by exchanging events a system could announce to the world when a particular business action is performed eg an order is placed the software systems interested in this event would listen to this announcement and react to it by performing certain actions eg shipping the item to the customer when the order is placed the software system announcing the event is called publisher and the software systems listening to the events are called consumers this architecture pattern is most suited for software systems requiring performing similar actions repeatedly but on different inputs and in parallel eg a software system requiring querying the order details of customers at a large rps in parallel in this architecture pattern there is a master component and multiple slave components the master component assigns the work action to the slave components and slave components perform the work and return the response to the master component the master component could then either calculate the final response based on responses from the slave or return the response based on any slaves response the clientserver architecture pattern comprises two components client who is the requester requesting an action and server who performs the action in this architectural pattern generally the client and server interact over a network a simple example of this is the world wide web an mvc architecture defines software components to be classified as model view and controller the model defines the core application data of the service it contains the structure of the data not how the data is used in the business actions it also doesnt define how the data is presented to the users of the software systems the view defines how the core application data is presented to the users and how the user could interact with it view doesnt know how the data is manipulated within the software system the controller handles the input from the users and manipulates the data defined in the model based on the input from the customers it does this by operating on the data elements defined in the model these components interact with each other using mechanisms like notifications eg an external notification from the user showing account details of a customer would be handled by the controller to update the view account details of the selected customer opinions expressed by dzone contributors are their own,Computing
monte carlo methods are a class of methods based on the idea of sampling to study mathematical problems for which analytical solutions may be unavailable the basic idea is to create samples through repeated simulations that can be used to derive approximations about a quantity were interested in and its probability distribution in this post well describe how you can use aws batch to run monte carlo simulations optimally and efficiently at scale well illustrate using an example from the financial sector the stock price prediction problem the monte carlo method was developed as a statistical computing tool in the mid1940s near the advent of computing machines john von neumann and stanislaw ulam first came up with the idea of using random numbers generated by a computer in order to solve problems encountered in the development of the atomic bomb the title of their paper the monte carlo method which gave birth to the monte carlo method is a reference to the famous casino in monaco you can read their paper yourself in the journal of the american statistical association 44335341 1949 monte carlo methods are widely used in a variety of fields like finance physics chemistry and biology and more in these fields many realistic models of systems of interest usually involve the assumption that at least some of the underlying variables behave in a random way for example in the financial domain the prices of different assets like stocks are assumed to evolve in time by following a random or stochastic process the monte carlo simulation method uses random sampling to study the properties of such systems by simulating on a computer the stochastic behavior of these systems in detail a computer is used to randomly generate values for the stochastic variables that influence the behavior of the system then for each stochastic simulation samples of the quantities of interest are computed which are further analyzed by methods of statistical inference the monte carlo method can also be used for problems that have no inherent probabilistic structure like computing highdimensional multivariate integrals or solving huge systems of linear equations while the main advantages of monte carlo methods over other techniques are ease of implementation and parallelization it does have some drawbacks one of the main drawbacks of monte carlo simulations is their slower rate of convergence compared to some other specialized techniques like socalled quasimonte carlo methods when you have a large number of variables bound to distinct constraints this method might be computationally challenging it can be demanding in terms of computing power and computing time to approximate a solution in this post well use monte carlo methods to value and analyze some financial assets by simulating the various sources of uncertainty affecting their value usually done with the help of stochastic asset models and then determine the distribution of their value over the range of resultant outcomes well walk through technical details to efficiently scale and optimize your monte carlo simulations but we wont focus on any specific data preparation or processing steps the architecture we will create is depicted in figure 1 figure 1 in this architecture well use amazon s3 for data storage aws batch for scheduling ecr to source containers and spot instances for largescale and lowcost capacity in our architecture we use several services  figure 2 in our solution the key services that enable largescale elasticity are aws batch and amazon s3 the monte carlo simulations workflow proceeds in the form of two serial jobs to get a sense of the scaling of this solution in the usecase where job 1 is a job array consisting of 5 jobs the maximum runtime across all the array jobs was around 2 seconds and job 2 for analyzing the results of the monte carlo simulations of the first job also completed in 2 seconds this solution can be trivially scaled up to 10000 simulations the maximum size for array jobs supported in aws batch currently by submitting job 1 with the size field in the arrayproperties parameter set to the desired number of simulations because all the other services we use in this solution like amazon s3 and amazon ecr are inherently scalable too theres no additional work involved to get there to apply this to the stock price prediction problem we use sample data obtained from yfinance which is a reliable threaded and pythonic way to download historical market data from yahoo finance in finance quantities like stock prices are usually assumed to evolve in time following a stochastic path for example in the standard blackscholes model the stock price is assumed to evolve in time by a stochastic process known as geometric brownian motion gbm many problems in mathematical finance involve the computation of a particular integral like finding the arbitragefree value of a particular derivative in some cases these integrals can be computed analytically but more often theyre computed using numerical integration or by solving a partial differential equation pde however when the number of dimensions or degrees of freedom in the problem is large pdes and numerical integrals become intractable and in these cases monte carlo methods often give better results in particular for more than three or four state variables formulae such as blackscholes ie analytic solutions just dont exist while other numerical methods like the binomial options pricing model and finite difference methods face several difficulties making them impractical in these cases monte carlo methods converge to the solution more quickly than numerical methods need less memory and are easier to program monte carlo methods can also deal with derivatives that have pathdependent payoffs in a fairly straightforward manner there are a lot of advantages of this architectural design compared to traditional approaches for performing monte carlo simulations first since aws batch is a managed service theres no need to install and manage batch computing software or server clusters to run your jobs batch also dynamically provisions the right quantity and type of compute resources like cpu or memoryoptimized instances based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the jobs in the queue and we have more to say on this topic in our documentation on allocation strategies this is a significant freedom compared to the constraints of fixedcapacity clusters with a bringyourown container approach you can choose any framework and algorithm without extensive changes to your code base and finally just using amazon ec2 spot instances can save you up to 70 on your compute costs in this post weve described how to efficiently scale and optimize your monte carlo simulations using aws batch we also discussed the technical details of the architecture and hopefully youll see some of the advantages of using this approach an almost identical setup can be used for other use cases like option pricing or portfolio analysis you can get started implementing the solutions described here by following the directions in the awssamples

many organizations struggle to keep an application development workflow that is secure against data leaks while jointly preserving developers experience and productivity this challenge has driven market demand for secure development environments especially due to developers being increasingly targeted by hackers breaches are notably around source code and credentials see also this report some leading to personal information leaks in this article ill start with a quick rundown of the technologies available to organizations to address this challenge then ill compare them across three dimensions their applicability to support an application development process their focus on security and their impact on developer experience at the end of this article ill give a nuanced conclusion in the sense that choosing any of these technologies shouldnt necessarily be clearcut in other words mixing them could even be beneficial in some cases the need to protect the development workflow has led to the emergence of technologies such as virtual desktops notably from organizations such as citrix virtual desktop infrastructure or vdi and vmware horizon etc these are generalpurpose desktops windows or linux where developers can install applications like integrated development environments ide and devops tools eg container management and access web applications supporting their workflow in effect remote access to a virtual desktop removes the need to maintain sensitive data on the local device in addition it provides access to an alternative source of computing power to build applications a typical access method for the remote desktop is the remote desktop protocol rdp which streams the desktop image to the local device more recently enterprise browsers with companies such as island talon and citrix have appeared as webbased alternatives to virtual desktops although the focus is securing access to web applications typically saas services as opposed to providing access to a desktop however these browsers also support protocols such as rdp to provide access to remote desktops also as virtual machines vendors in this field often position themselves as a vdi replacement a marked difference is that their offerings typically do not include computing resources unlike citrix and vmwares offerings hence it is likely that organizations adopt them in the scope of a broader infrastructure setup including desktopasaservice daas when computing resources are needed as a means to secure an application development process recent technology is secure cloud development environments cdes and the associated platform used to manage them the basic role of such a platform is to provide online access to development environments with security mechanisms via an ide in addition to providing secured access to the web applications used by developers eg for code management for the latter a technology similar to the one used for enterprise browsers is used the combination of remote access via ide and secured web browsing aims at protecting the entire developer workflow against data leaks like in the case of a virtual desktop local development data is in effect removed from local devices and computing is delivered via the cloud hence secure cdes can be seen as a technology blending aspects of the previous two presented here the figure below depicts the three technologies compared in this article  figure from left to right a thin client accesses a remote desktop while an enterprise browser provides access to both web applications and remote desktops via rdp on the right a secure cde platform provides a combination of remote access to a development environment via an ide and secure web browsing lets dive now into key differences between the three technologies and highlight roles and benefits note that albeit virtual desktops and enterprise browsers are business processagnostic i only discuss their application in securing application development here in the context of code development virtual desktops are used across business units but more commonly in scenarios involving the onboarding of remote developers implementation of byod policies and others requiring centralized control and security over remote desktop environments mostly windowsbased although linux hosts are also used any code development activities are performed on a generic desktop which typically requires the installation of tools such as an ide to start coding as illustrated in the picture below left the remote desktop is used to code using the ide and access a code management application the remote desktop is also the primary source of compute to build applications when used in the scope of a development process an enterprise browser acts as a web frontend to access a remote desktop setup for development via rdp because secure browsers impose fewer infrastructure constraints than virtual desktops they can be more easily deployed across both internal and remote developers still enterprise browsers do not provide any development environments by themselves hence in this setting they are merely the frontend to an existing park of development machines physical or virtual accessed via the browser client hence in the scope of a development process where a source of compute is needed the setup is similar to a virtual desktop a small difference is that the code management application in this case can be accessed securely using the browser on the developer device as opposed to a browser running on the virtual desktop here too the remote desktop is the primary source of compute to build applications this is shown in the middle part of the figure below a secure cde platform is designed to onboard both internal and remote developers incl byod on centrally managed and standardized environments to run environments the platform relies on lightweight virtualization using containers ie a virtual process as opposed to a virtual machine hence setup and operations are much more efficient and more scalable because containers require fewer resources hence it is easy and economical to assign multiple environments to a single developer each container has its own source of compute and is easy to set or reconfigure without any loss of data  figure from left to right in both the cases of virtual desktops and enterprise browsers a virtual machine hosts all the tools computing power and provides connection to devops services secure cloud development provides access via ide and secure browser to containerized environments and services respectively the striking difference with a remote desktop is that developers do not need a desktop to develop applications the platform is primarily suited for cloudnative ie webbased backendfrontend and mobile development left part in the next figure the cloud environment is accessed directly via the ide and developers typically run web applications on an environments port the running application is then accessed via a local web browser note that it is possible to run a desktop on the containers if needed in this case it is steamed over a port and accessed via the browser as well right part of the figure below  figure secure cloudbased development does not require a desktop to build backend web and mobile applications the same mechanism used to run applications on containers lets users access a desktop when necessary what about their security focus virtual desktops secure the enduser environment by centralizing data and desktop applications reducing endpoint vulnerabilities both citrix and vmware clients offer data leak prevention dlp measures that protect from data exfiltration via system hardening measures encompassing user access data egress restrictions etc enterprise browsers aim to protect the organization from phishing malware and other threats when accessing web applications and from user operations that could result in data leaks including insider threats using dlp as well in the case of enterprise browsers security measures are primarily clientfocused because users do not have access to the backend of the application they use security measures are more complex and include network policies in the case of virtual desktops such policies might be necessary to avoid data exfiltration using internet connectivity once on the remote application this shows a potential limitation of enterprise browsers as a vdi replacement when accessing desktops it is likely that no secure measures are provided to protect from operations on the desktop however this aspect could depend on the vendordependent a secure cde platform focuses on securing data in development environments and web applications against exfiltration this is akin to clientside dlp the platform also provides backend dlp by protecting access to the data used for development this is achieved by controlling the network and providing authentication services to the organizations resources although a cdebased infrastructure is simpler than a virtual desktop counterpart it is indeed this simplicity that allows it to build a more holistic approach to data loss prevention with minimal impact on the local device used to access the platform an additional aspect is that because a secure cde platform is designed to support application development security mechanisms can beneficially use the context to make security a productivity enabler as opposed to a hassle accessibility to the platform and more generally the developer experience are important factors when assessing the fitness of these technologies to support development virtual desktops lets developers interact with a remote desktop via a locally installed client by streaming the image of the remote desktop to the client such access protocol often suffers from latency due to network requirements which unfortunately impacts the developer experience check this reallife story enterprise browsers let developers access web applications without usability issues however because developers need access to a remote desktop for coding this requires again the use of a streaming protocol such as rdp and results in display latency impacting the developer experience and productivity  figure in the case of a secure cde platform the ide used for coding right part is not streamed to the desktop and rendered locally which preserves the developers experience in comparison secure browsing might be implemented using streaming left part a secure cde platform provides developers access to the online development environment via a webbased ide and to web applications via a secure browser the webbased ide is a web application on its own and renders natively in the browser on the developers device hence no streaming is required which provides optimal developer experience see the above figure in contrast the chosen implementation for the secure browser can impact the experience however in practice developers spend the majority of their time in the ide and use web applications for less frequent operations such as pull requests in general virtual desktops and enterprise browsers play an important role across enterprise business processes by providing generalpurpose security for desktops and web applications each with distinct infrastructure requirements and performance outcomes historically virtual desktops have been a staple in the enterprise environment representing the oldest technology among the ones that i discussed in this article in comparison enterprise browsers are designed as a lightweight alternative to virtual desktop infrastructure they are however optimized mainly for saas applications delivered through the web their utilization for accessing developer desktops via rdp is akin to a modern reinterpretation of virtual desktops via a web browser to protect the application development process a secure cloud development environment cde platform centralizes all essential resources including access to clients ide and web applications and development environments in one place the targeted usage allows the platform to offer contextspecific security and preserves the developer experience when working in a secure environment in a larger organizational context integrating a secure cde platform with virtual desktops or an existing enterprise browser setup might be necessary this provides an opportunity to balance development productivity security and asset utilization optimally one key feature of a secure cde platform is its use of a dedicated browser for safe access to web applications this feature is particularly enhanced when integrated with an enterprise browser or application virtualization technologies essentially this integration allows for replacing the cde platforms secure browser with a more seamless solution and incorporates secure cde technologies into the existing infrastructure this way organizations can standardize security mechanisms across the infrastructure ensuring access to legacy applications while modernizing application development it also offers them an opportunity to improve asset utilization by leveraging lightweight virtualization for ondemand access to cheap computing power dedicated to development workloads see the next figure in the implementation of a virtual desktop infrastructure incorporating a secure cde platform elevates the developer experience by providing ondemand development environments with associated computational resources and bolstering data access security  figure the combination of the secure cde platform and the other technologies to fit different needs and scenarios in an enterprise setting in conclusion integrations between secure cde platforms enterprise browsers and virtual desktops provide opportunities for enhancing both the security and productivity of the development process while jointly improving developer experience and resource utilization although a secure cde platform alone provides a contemporary approach to prevent data leaks during application development it also delivers an opportunity to enrich the existing

introductory note this article has been coauthored by federico trotta and karin wolok stream processing is a distributed computing paradigm that supports the gathering processing and analysis of highvolume and continuous data streams to extract insights in real time as were living in a world where more and more data is born as streams allowing analysts to extract insights in realtime for faster business decisions we wanted to propose a gentle introduction to this topic stream processing is a programming paradigm that views streams  also called sequences of events in time  as the central input and output objects of computation  stream processing image by federico trotta unlike traditional batch processing  which handles data in chunks  stream processing allows us to work with data as a constant flow making it ideal for scenarios where immediacy and responsiveness are fundamental  so stream processing means computing and processing data in motion and real time this is important in todays world because the majority of data today is born as continuous streams  a stream of data image by federico trotta lets think about cases like sensor events user activity on a website or financial trades sensors for example continuously collect data from the environment in which they are installed in real time this provides applications for weather monitoring industrial automation iot devices and many more also if we think of websites we can say that they are platforms where users dynamically engage in various activities such as clicking scrolling typing and more these interactions which are continuously generated are captured in realtime to analyze user behavior improve user experience and make timely adjustments just to mention a few activities in financial markets today transactions occur rapidly and continuously stock prices currency values and other financial metrics are constantly changing and require realtime data processing to make rapid decisions so the objective of stream processing is to quickly analyze filter transform or enhance data in real time once processed the data is passed off to an application data store or another stream processing engine given the nature of stream processes data are processed in different ways with respect to batch processing lets discuss how incremental computation is a technique used to optimize computational processes allowing them to process only the parts of the data that have changed since a previous computation rather than recomputing the entire result from scratch this technique is particularly useful for saving computational resources  incremental computation image by federico trotta in the context of stream processing incremental computation involves updating results continuously as new data arrives rather than recalculating everything from scratch each time to give an example lets say we have a stream of sensor data from iot devices measuring temperature in a factory we want to calculate the average temperature over a sliding window of time such as the average temperature over the last 5 minutes and we want to update this average in realtime as new sensor data arrives instead of recalculating the entire average every time new data arrives which could be computationally expensive especially as the dataset grows we can use incremental computation to update the average efficiently in the context of stream processing we can perform different sets of transformations to an incoming data stream some of them are typical transformations we can always make on data while others are specific for the realtime case among the others we can mention the following methodologies filtering this is the act of removing unwanted data from the whole data stream based on specified conditions  data filtering image by federico trotta aggregation this involves summing averaging counting or finding any other statistical measure to gain insight from a given stream of data over specific intervals  data aggregation image by federico trotta enrichment its the act of enhancing the incoming data by adding additional information from external sources this process can provide more context to the data making it more valuable for downstream applications  data enrichment image by federico trotta transformation data transformation is a general way to modify data formats with this methodology we apply various transformations to the data such as converting data formats normalizing values or extracting specific fields ensuring that the data is in the desired format for further analysis or integration  data transformation image by federico trotta windowing its the act of dividing the continuous stream into discrete windows of data this allows us to analyze data within specific time frames enabling the detection of trends and patterns over different intervals  windowing image by federico trotta load balancing and scaling its a way to distribute the processing load across multiple nodes to achieve scalability stream processing frameworks in fact often support parallelization and distributed computing to handle large volumes of data efficiently  the process of load balancing and scaling image by federico trotta stateful stream processing its a type of transformation that involves processing a continuous stream of data in real time while also maintaining the current state of the data that has been processed this allows the system to process each event as received while also tracking changes in the data stream over time by including the history and the context of the data  pattern recognition as understandable this is a kind of transformation that searches for a set of event patterns it is particularly interesting in the case of data streams as the data are in a continuous flow because it can also intercept anomalies in the flow  to gain a deeper understanding of stream processing lets consider some realworld use cases due to the increased online transactions fraudsters are becoming increasingly sophisticated and detecting fraudulent activities in realtime is crucial to prevent financial losses and protect customers in this case stream processing is applied to analyze incoming transactions looking for patterns or anomalies that might indicate fraudulent behaviors for example if someone clones your credit card and buys something from a location on the other side of the world from where you reside the system recognizes a fraudulent transaction thanks to stream processing and machine learning in todays interconnected world devices and sensors generate vast amounts of data for industries like manufacturing predicting equipment failures and performing proactive maintenance are critical to minimize downtime and reduce operational costs in this case stream processing is employed to analyze data streams from iot sensors applying algorithms for anomaly detection trend analysis and pattern recognition this helps companies with the early identification of potential equipment failures or deviations from normal operating conditions trading systems generate a constant stream of financial data including stock prices trading volumes and other market indicators since anomaly detection is a crucial aspect of trading systems helping to identify unusual patterns or behaviors in financial data that may indicate potential issues errors or fraudulent activities sophisticated algorithms are employed to analyze the data stream in real time and identify patterns that deviate from normal market behavior in advertising analytics the use of data streams is fundamental in gathering processing and analyzing vast amounts of realtime data to optimize ad campaigns understand user behavior and measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts data streams allow advertisers to monitor ad campaigns in real time and metrics such as impressions clicks conversions and engagement can be continuously tracked providing immediate insights into the performance of advertising assets as stream processing involves dealing with data in real time they have to be managed differently from how data in batches are what we mean is that the classical database is no longer sufficient whats really needed is an ecosystem not just a database that can manage data on the fly in this section we introduce some topics and concepts that will be deepened in upcoming deep articles on streaming systems and databases apache kafka is an opensource distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for highperformance data pipelines streaming analytics data integration and missioncritical applications kafka in particular is an ecosystem that provides a streaming database called ksqldb but also tools and integrations to help data engineers implement a stream processing architecture to existing data sources apache flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams flink has been designed to run in all common cluster environments and perform computations at inmemory speed and at any scale in particular apache flink is a powerful stream processing framework suitable for realtime analytics and complex event processing while kafka is a distributed streaming platform primarily used for building realtime data pipelines risingwave is a distributed sql streaming database that enables simple efficient and reliable processing of streaming data risingwave reduces the complexity of building streamprocessing applications by allowing developers to express intricate streamprocessing logic through cascaded materialized views furthermore it allows users to persist data directly within the system eliminating the need to deliver results to external databases for storage and query serving in particular risingwave can gather data in realtime from various applications sensors and devices social media apps websites and more as a gentle introduction to stream processing in this article weve defined what stream processing is how it differs from batch processing and how computation works in stream processing weve also reported some use cases to show how the theory of stream processes applies to realworld examples like manufacturing and finance finally we introduced some solutions on how to implement stream

the slow java startup problem is notorious in the java community but the meaning can confuse the observer the slow startup problem relates to the process of starting a set of interconnected applications on complex java frameworks this process includes starting several applications in spring boot and each of them takes around 10 seconds so the start of such production as a whole will take a minute but the start of a jvm in this set is 50 milliseconds the widespread meaning of slow java startup referred to this process is not exactly true as technically this is not a java problem but a problem of the framework the effect of slow startup and warmup is caused by complex frameworks that we use and dynamic features in the runtime java is unique in its functionalities and thanks to its coding and ecosystem power java is very popular among enterprises the same complexity though can make it clumsy in the cloud java application startup and warmup technically include several consecutive processes jvm startup application startup and jvm warmup in these processes the jvm gets extra time to provide application peak performance the warmup phase is taken by jvm to compile and optimize the code this process is needed for code interpretation and optimization and lasts substantially longer than the startup in cases of large complex applications taking up to several minutes every time you start your program these processes begin from scratch in practice it means that we spend time running the application and use significant cpu and memory resources to ensure its performance at the startup point therefore the slow startup and warmup leads to extra resources spent for the phase preparing the application to run rather than the resources that might be required for its operation consequently with the slow startup and warmup you get increased cloud costs and resource over utilization there are several ways to deal with the issue the slow startup problem impacts the overall performance of your runtime and to make your application sustainable and performant you need to use one of these solutions among the abovementioned technologies native image is the most adopted in the java community and is specifically useful for spring users to achieve faster startup of their applications its been around for quite some time and it can lead to increased performance allow programs to run in less memory and not require a standalone jdk for deployment most frameworks support graalvm and the migration to graalvm is straightforward at the same time due to the closedworld assumption graalvm may require individual research given the specifics of your java application and it will not always be suitable for resolving the startup issue the crac solution carries many expectations of the java community crac just like project leyden is targeted to solve the issue of slow startup today you can get openjdk runtime and even containers that support the crac api these solutions are ready to install and allow immediate significant improvements openjdk runtimes and small containers with crac support possess a high value for spring developers as spring announced crac feature support in 2023 the key crac advantage is its ease of use combined with an instant effect on the application performance and cloud costs openjdk runtime with support for coordinated restore at checkpoint advances your application with a feature to quickly create and restore images of a running application reducing the startup and warmup times from minutes to milliseconds enhancing your application with linuxbased containers supported with crac strengthens its performance even further crac lowers the load on the processor and memory at the application startup reducing the cloud costs and improving application performance and sustainability we cannot evaluate and test the leyden results fully yet the project introduced class data sharing  aot on steroids which looks very promising for synergy with java capable of delivering faster startup on jvm however there are no readymade solutions that can be deployed with java yet in the case of amazon lambdas you should consider the costs of this product and its effectiveness as it might ultimately deliver an extra financial burden its main advantage is convenience as a conclusion to this opinion piece i want to emphasize the vastness of todays java ecosystem and the various ways the java community offers to deal with a single issue of the java startup in complex workloads the choice of readymade tools depends on your application requirements but surely enough there is more than one method out there to make your java both cloudnative and sustainable your java journey is always complete with the right vendor capable of delivering all the depth of those offerings for your development routine opinions expressed by dzone contributors are their own,Computing
when it comes to api security authentication is usually the main topic of conversation a surprising number of apis continue to rely on outofdate web application firewalls and traditional perimeter security techniques to protect their critical http endpoints despite the changing nature of cyber threats and the growing complexity of the api landscape many organizations have yet to update their security measures to reflect these changes this reliance on antiquated methods not only makes apis vulnerable to sophisticated attacks but also limits their ability to adapt to the changing needs of modern it infrastructures nonetheless as the api economy grows it becomes increasingly clear that more advanced solutions are required every time i meet with an organization that is starting an api journey i stress how important it is to have a thorough api program in place this means appreciating the transformative potential of apis in terms of digital innovation and business agility in addition to knowing the differences between modern apis and traditional service endpoints apis are not merely technical components but rather intricate business constructs that play a pivotal role in shaping the digital landscape beyond their technical functionality apis embody the strategic vision and objectives of businesses facilitating the seamless exchange of data services and functionalities across disparate systems and platforms according to the open web application security project owasp apis are vulnerable to various security threats that can jeopardize data and service confidentiality integrity and availability owasp has identified several common api vulnerabilities including injection attacks such as sql and nosql injection broken authentication sensitive data exposure broken access controls xml external entity xxe attacks security misconfiguration insufficient logging and monitoring and improper error handling attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data execute arbitrary code escalate privileges and disrupt api functionality furthermore apis are vulnerable to a variety of threats including ddos attacks brute force attacks and api abuse which can overload servers exhaust resources and cause service outages overall addressing these api vulnerabilities and security threats is critical to the strength and resilience of apibased systems in a microservices architecture or api ecosystem an api gateway acts as a centralized entry point for controlling safeguarding and optimizing interactions between clients and backend services it essentially plays the role of a traffic cop directing incoming requests from apis to the relevant backend services and enforcing rules and regulations to guarantee security dependability and efficiency authentication and authorization request routing and transformation rate limitation caching logging and monitoring are just a few of the features that api gateways offer api gateways make api management easier by combining these functions into a single scalable infrastructure component this allows businesses to improve control visibility and governance over their apis the use of an api gateway a crucial element that simplifies api management and improves security posture is essential to any successful api strategy an api gateway functions as a single point of entry for all incoming api requests giving businesses the ability to impose uniform policies limit traffic and track performance indicators with unmatched detail the choice of an acceptable authentication method is a crucial next step after setting up the gateway one that has a big impact on the user experience and security its important to understand that although authentication plays a significant role in api security its only one aspect of the puzzle a common mistake made by many is to undervalue the significance of adding supplementary security layers like rate limitation to strengthen their api defenses this oversight frequently results in weaknesses that bad actors can take advantage of this is the moment when apis go wrong api rate limiting is the practice of limiting the number of requests a user or client can make to an api within a given time frame it essentially limits the frequency or volume of api calls that can be made from a single source to prevent abuse misuse or overloading of the api infrastructure ratelimiting policies allow api providers to manage and regulate traffic flow ensuring fair access to resources while protecting against potential security threats such as ddos brute force attacks and unauthorized access rate limiting contributes to system stability improves security posture and optimizes resource utilization for both providers and consumers by enforcing api usage restrictions rate limiting serves as a protective measure that lessens the effects of possible security lapses especially in situations where authentication systems are breached for example in the event that tokens are made public as a result of a breach malicious actors not only acquire access to credentials that may be useful but they also learn more about the fundamental design of keys or tokens armed with this information attackers can more effectively exploit the compromised api endpoints by launching more focused and powerful bruteforce attacks in order to successfully implement ratelimiting regulations inside api management systems a number of typical strategies are used by putting effective ratelimiting measures in place organizations can drastically lower the risk that different kinds of attacks pose organizations can successfully thwart malicious attempts to overwhelm their systems with excessive traffic or exploit vulnerabilities by imposing reasonable limits on the number of requests allowed within a specified timeframe ratelimiting techniques help organizations protect their assets preserve operational stability and lessen the possible impact of security breaches by acting as a proactive defense mechanism essentially even though authentication is still a crucial component of api security it is only one part of a much bigger picture the modern api ecosystem demands a nuanced approach that encompasses not just authentication but also robust authorization mechanisms data encryption rate limiting

plasma making up 99 of the visible universe exists predominantly in stars and space it forms when electrons detach from atoms creating ions and free electrons a state that can conduct electricity and exhibits complex behaviors plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter alongside gases liquids and solids while most people dont think about plasma in their daily lives the way they think about other states of matter plasma constitutes 99 of the visible matter in the universe this includes astrophysical plasma found in outer space such as within nebulae and stars like the sun in plasma some of the electrons separate and become free from neutral atoms atoms that have an equal number of protons and electrons and thus a neutral charge the resulting free electrons make plasma different from the other states of matter where the electrons remain closely held to nuclei when the atoms in plasma separate from their negatively charged electrons they no longer have a neutral electrical charge instead the atoms become ionspositively charged particles therefore plasma is an ionized state made up of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons the aurora borealis forms from particles colliding in waves in plasma in the earths atmosphere credit frank olsen there are several reasons why electrons in atoms can separate and form plasma in laboratory experiments scientists can blast the atoms with highvoltage electricity lasers or electromagnetic fields to form plasma in space plasma may form from highenergy photons including gamma rays striking atoms plasma can also form in space when gravity increases the pressure so much that it superheats gases the high temperatures cause atoms to collide with each other resulting in the electrons separating from the atoms creating plasma and the beginnings of a star this process of gases being superheated to create plasma suggests that gases and plasma have a relationship similar to how liquid can be a heated form of a solid this analogy is not always correct for one unlike gas plasma can conduct electricity also in gases all the particles behave in similar ways in plasma however electrons and ions behave and interact in very complex ways which creates waves and instabilities plasmas come in several types most plasma in the universe is what researchers call hightemperature plasmas in these hightemperature plasmas temperatures can be more than 10000 degrees fahrenheit and all the atoms can be fully ionized lowtemperature plasmas are different the atoms are only partially ionized and they can be incredibly cooleven room temperature another unusual type of plasma is highenergy density plasma which scientists create in laboratories to study their unusual properties studying plasma helps scientists understand matter it also helps them progress toward the goal of fusion energy the department of energy doe office of science supports research into plasma through its fusion energy sciences and nuclear physics programs doefunded research on plasma has also improved the manufacturing of the semiconductors found in everything from phones and computers to cars expertise in plasma helped researchers at the doe national laboratories develop ways to control the creation of semiconductors on an atombyatom level,Physics
university of illinois researchers have developed a faster more insightful method to model diffusion in alloys using kinosons and machine learning potentially revolutionizing how this critical process is understood and studied credit scitechdailycom researchers at the university of illinois urbanachampaign have redefined diffusion in multicomponent alloys by breaking it down into separate elements they term kinosons employing machine learning they analyzed the statistical distribution of these elements enabling them to model the alloy and determine its diffusivity much more efficiently than by calculating entire trajectories their findings were recently published in the journal physical review letters we found a much more efficient way to calculate diffusion in solids and at the same time we learned more about the fundamental processes of diffusion in that same system says materials science  engineering professor dallas trinkle who led this work along with graduate student soham chattopadhyay diffusion in solids is the process by which atoms move throughout a material the production of steel ions moving through a battery and the doping of semiconductor devices are all things that are controlled by diffusion here the team modeled diffusion in multicomponent alloys which are metals composed of five different elementsmanganese cobalt chromium iron and nickel in this researchin equal amounts these types of alloys are interesting because one way to make strong materials is to add different elements together like adding carbon and iron to make steel multicomponent alloys have unique properties such as good mechanical behavior and stability at high temperatures so it is important to understand how atoms diffuse in these materials a series of states dots connected with transitions lines in a complex system bigger dots correspond to states where more time is spent during simulation thicker lines for faster transitions to look at long trajectories with many jumps takes a lot of computational effort the machine learning model converts this system left to an equivalent one that has the same diffusivity behavior but where calculation of diffusion is much simpler right in the uncorrelated system each jump corresponds to a kinoson a small contribution to diffusion and the sum of all kinosons gives the diffusivity credit the grainger college of engineering at the university of illinois urbanachampaign to get a good look at diffusion long timescales are needed since atoms randomly move around and over time their displacement from the starting point will grow if somebody tries to simulate the diffusion its a pain because you have to run the simulation for a very long time to get the full picture trinkle says that really limits a lot of the ways that we can study diffusion more accurate methods for calculating transition rates often cant be used because you wouldnt be able to do enough steps of a simulation to get the longtime trajectory and get a reasonable value of diffusion an atom might jump to the left but then it might jump back to the right in that case the atom hasnt moved anywhere now say it jumps left then 1000 other things happen then it jumps back to the right thats the same effect trinkle says we call that correlation because at one point the atom made one jump and then later it undid that jump thats what makes diffusion complicated when we look at how machine learning is solving the problem what its really doing is its changing the problem into one where there arent any of these correlated jumps therefore any jump that an atom makes contributes to diffusion and the problem becomes a lot easier to solve we call those jumps kinosons for little moves trinkle says weve shown that you can extract the distribution of those the probability of seeing a kinoson of a certain magnitude and add them all up to get the true diffusivity on top of that you can tell how different elements are diffusing in a solid another advantage of modeling diffusion using kinosons and machine learning is that it is significantly faster than calculating longtimescale whole trajectories trinkle says that with this method simulations can be done 100 times faster than it would take with the normal methods i think this method is really going to change the way we think about diffusion he says its a different way to look at the problem and i hope that in the next 10 years this will be the standard way of looking at diffusion to me one of the exciting things is not just that it works faster but you also learn more about whats happening in the system reference contributions to diffusion in complex materials quantified with machine learning by soham chattopadhyay and dallas r trinkle 30 april 2024 physical review letters doi 101103physrevlett132186301 this research was funded by the national science foundation under program no mps1940303,Physics
researchers have developed a new method called wavefunction matching to tackle the sign problem in monte carlo simulations a common issue in quantum manybody physics by simplifying the interaction model and using perturbation theory for corrections this method has proven effective in accurately calculating nuclear properties like mass and radius it holds promise for broader applications in quantum computing and other fields credit prof serdar elhatisari strongly interacting systems are crucial in the fields of quantum physics and quantum chemistry monte carlo simulations a type of stochastic method are widely used to study these systems however they face challenges when dealing with sign oscillations an international team of researchers from germany turkey the usa china south korea and france has addressed this issue by developing a new technique called wavefunction matching as an example the masses and radii of all nuclei up to mass number 50 were calculated using this method the results agree with the measurements the researchers now report in the journal nature all matter on earth consists of tiny particles known as atoms each atom contains even smaller particles protons neutrons and electrons each of these particles follows the rules of quantum mechanics quantum mechanics forms the basis of quantum manybody theory which describes systems with many particles such as atomic nuclei one class of methods used by nuclear physicists to study atomic nuclei is the ab initio approach it describes complex systems by starting from a description of their elementary components and their interactions in the case of nuclear physics the elementary components are protons and neutrons some key questions that ab initio calculations can help answer are the binding energies and properties of atomic nuclei and the link between nuclear structure and the underlying interactions between protons and neutrons however these ab initio methods have difficulties in performing reliable calculations for systems with complex interactions one of these methods is quantum monte carlo simulations here quantities are calculated using random or stochastic processes although quantum monte carlo simulations can be efficient and powerful they have a significant weakness the sign problem it arises in processes with positive and negative weights which cancel each other this cancellation leads to inaccurate final predictions a new approach known as wavefunction matching is intended to help solve such calculation problems for ab initio methods this problem is solved by the new method of wavefunction matching by mapping the complicated problem in a first approximation to a simple model system that does not have such sign oscillations and then treating the differences in perturbation theory says prof ulfg meiner from the helmholtz institute for radiation and nuclear physics at the university of bonn and from the institute of nuclear physics and the center for advanced simulation and analytics at forschungszentrum jlich as an example the masses and radii of all nuclei up to mass number 50 were calculated  and the results agree with the measurements reports meiner who is also a member of the transdisciplinary research areas modeling and matter at the university of bonn in quantum manybody theory we are often faced with the situation that we can perform calculations using a simple approximate interaction but realistic highfidelity interactions cause severe computational problems says dean lee professor of physics from the facility for rare istope beams and department of physics and astronomy frib at michigan state university and head of the department of theoretical nuclear sciences wavefunction matching solves this problem by removing the shortdistance part of the highfidelity interaction and replacing it with the shortdistance part of an easily calculable interaction this transformation is done in a way that preserves all the important properties of the original realistic interaction since the new wavefunctions are similar to those of the easily computable interaction the researchers can now perform calculations with the easily computable interaction and apply a standard procedure for handling small corrections  called perturbation theory the research team applied this new method to lattice quantum monte carlo simulations for light nuclei mediummass nuclei neutron matter and nuclear matter using precise ab initio calculations the results closely matched realworld data on nuclear properties such as size structure and binding energy calculations that were once impossible due to the sign problem can now be performed with wavefunction matching while the research team focused exclusively on quantum monte carlo simulations wavefunction matching should be useful for many different ab initio approaches this method can be used in both classical computing and quantum computing for example to better predict the properties of socalled topological materials which are important for quantum computing says meiner reference wavefunction matching for solving quantum manybody problems by serdar elhatisari lukas

electrons are elementary subatomic particles with negligible mass that surround the nucleus of an atom they are bound to the nucleus due to electromagnetic attraction with neutral atoms having equal numbers of protons and electrons electrons can absorb energy and escape from the nucleus forming ions when they lose or gain electrons the electron is a subatomic particle that is present in all atoms unlike protons neutrons or the nuclei of atoms electrons are elementary particles this means they are not composed of even smaller particles also unlike protons and neutrons electrons have essentially no mass finally electrons are different from protons and neutrons in that they surround the nucleus instead of being part of the nucleus normally electrons are bound to the nuclei of atoms this happens because electrons have a negative charge that interacts with the positive charge of the nucleus of an atom in a neutral atom the number of electrons is the same as the number of positive charges in the nucleus all the elements of the periodic table are neutral however any atom can have more or fewer electrons than positive charges this makes the atom negatively or positively charged these charged atoms are known as ions more specifically negatively charged ions are called anions and positively charged ions are called cations this image shows the probability of finding hydrogens electron in the base n1 and excited states n2 and n3 light areas indicate higher probability the rows l indicate the electrons angular momentum credit university physics vol 3 by openstax cc by 40 atoms lose electrons because of how they interact with forces beyond atomic nuclei when an electron gains extra energy it can become excited this can happen when an electron absorbs a photon a packet of light or collides with a nearby atom or particle electrons can gain enough energy to leave atomic nuclei behind these free electrons mix with ions to form a plasma electrons can separate from atoms because of the way they surround nuclei in the past scientists believed electrons orbited nuclei in the same way the moon orbits the earth however scientists now believe electrons surround nuclei in a cloud divided into shells these shells are similar to the different layers in the earths atmosphere however electrons do not exist in specific points in these shells because of quantum mechanics electrons act as both points and waves this means the areas within the shells have different probabilities of containing electrons atoms have multiple shells each with a different number of subshells shells can hold more and more electrons the further they are from the nucleus and electrons have higher and higher energy levels as they move to shells away from the nucleus if the two outer shells are full the element is much less reactive with other elements this low reactivity is why the elements in the last column of the periodic tablehelium neon etcare called the noble gases because they dont react when electrons become excited and gain energy then relax and return to their original shells the atom emits a photon the wavelength of the photon depends on how far the electron falls back toward the atoms nucleus these wavelengths are specific to each element the doe office of nuclear physics in the office of science supports research to understand all forms of nuclear matter and the subatomic particles that make up atomic nuclei this research includes unraveling previously unknown properties of atoms and the subatomic particles they are composed of in their natural state for important applications in medicine commerce and national defense another area of study is understanding precisely how nuclei are structured depending on the number of protons and neutrons inside them other research focuses on heating nuclei to the temperature of the early universe to understand how they condensed out of the quarkgluon soup that existed at the time,Physics
researchers have recently revealed new insights into exotic subatomic particles and the strong force their work predicts the existence of a novel tetraquark composed of beauty and charm quarks along with two light antiquarks using computational methods this discovery enhances our understanding of quantum chromodynamics and the composition of visible matter credit scitechdailycom a new study unveils the existence of a tetraquark composed of beauty and charm quarks advancing our knowledge of subatomic particle physics and strong force interactions exploring the complex domain of subatomic particles scientists at the institute of mathematical science imsc and the tata institute of fundamental research tifr have recently published a novel finding in the journal physical review letters their study illuminates a new horizon within quantum chromodynamics qcd shedding light on exotic subatomic particles and pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the strong force schematic picture of the predicted tetraquark tbc made of four quarks beauty charm quarks and two light antiquarks credit nilmani mathur at the core of this exploration lies the enigmatic fundamental strong force which generates almost all mass of all visible matter in the universe a handful of fundamental particles known as quarks engaging in intriguing interactions by exchanging gluons create all composite subatomic particles that eventually form all the visible matter of our universe central to this understanding is the theory of quantum chromodynamics qcd which governs the dynamics of strong interactions qcd allows the formation of colorneutral combinations of quarks into subatomic particles generically referred to as hadrons traditionally hadrons have been classified into two main categories mesons such as pions consisting of one quark and one antiquark and baryons like protons composed of three quarks however beyond these categories lie exotic hadrons including those with four five or six quarks and even particle with gluons such as glueballs until relatively recently however the existence of these exotic hadrons remained largely uncharted territory for particle physicists over the past decade and a half a flurry of experimental discoveries has illuminated this previously obscure domain unveiling a rich spectra of exotic hadrons that defy conventional notions of the strong force and challenging our understanding of subatomic particles schematic view showing the formation of tbc through interactions of a bottom and a charm mesons credit a radhakrishnan and v raj among these exotic hadrons are tetraquarks which are composed of four quarks more precisely two quarks and two antiquarks they could exist in highly compact forms or as loosely bound molecules of two mesons or something else their precise structures remain a mystery they are also observed to the most common exotics and it is expected that many more will be discovered in the future theoretical studies can aid in discovering those by predicting their quark contents and possible energy ranges in this recent work prof nilmani mathur and a postdoctoral fellow dr archana radhakrishnan from the department of theoretical physics tifr and dr m padmanath from imsc have predicted the existence of a novel tetraquark this new subatomic particle is composed of a beauty and a charm quarks along with two light antiquarks and it belongs to a family of tetraquarks called tbc the beautifulcharming tetraquarks they have utilized the computational facility of the indian lattice gauge theory initiative ilgti to carry out this calculation the formation of this particular tetraquark was investigated using the interactions between a bottom and a charm mesons utilizing variational techniques across varied lattice spacings and valence light quark masses this study investigated energy eigenvalues of the interacting meson systems within finite volumes and arrived at the conclusion on the existence of this tetraquark similar to the predicted particle there could be other tetraquarks with the same quark content but with different spin and parity this prediction arrives at a fortuitous moment coinciding with the recent discovery of a tetraquark tcc containing two charm quarks and two light antiquarks consequently there exists a distinct possibility that the newly predicted particle or a related variant could well be discovered using similar experimental methodologies given that the energy range and luminosity required for their production and detection are becoming increasingly accessible furthermore the binding energy of the predicted particle exceeds that of any discovered tetraquarks and the binding weakens as the mass of the light quark increases alluding to intricate dynamics of strong interactions across diverse quark mass regimes as well as elucidating the intriguing features of strong force in hadron formation particularly those with heavy quarks this also brings additional motivation to search for heavier exotic subatomic particles in nextgeneration experiments which could be utilized in deciphering the strong force and unlocking its full potential

researchers have developed new guidelines for molecular design that prevent electrons from losing energy through atomic vibrations these innovations promise to revolutionize the effectiveness of organic molecules used in oleds sensors and biomedical imaging credit scitechdailycom new molecular design rules discovered through laserbased spectroscopic techniques enable the uncoupling of electrons from atomic vibrations leading to significantly improved performance in applications such as oleds and biomedical imaging since the discovery of quantum mechanics more than a hundred years ago it has been known that electrons in molecules can be coupled to the motion of the atoms that make up the molecules often referred to as molecular vibrations the motion of atoms act like tiny springs undergoing periodic motion for electrons in these systems being joined to the hip with these vibrations means they are constantly in motion too dancing to the tune of the atoms on timescales of a millionth of a billionth of a second but all this dancing around leads to a loss of energy and limits the performance of organic molecules in applications like lightemitting diodes oleds infrared sensors and fluorescent biomarkers used in the study of cells and for tagging diseases such as cancer cells now researchers using laserbased spectroscopic techniques have discovered new molecular design rules capable of halting this molecular dance their results reported in nature revealed crucial design principles that can stop the coupling of electrons to atomic vibrations in effect shutting down their hectic dancing and propelling the molecules to achieve unparalleled performance artists illustration of an organic molecules light emission property modulated by quantum dance of the atoms credit pratyush ghosh cavendish laboratory university of cambridge edited all organic molecules such as those found in living cells or within the screen of your phone consist of carbon atoms connected to each other via a chemical bond said cavendish phd student pratyush ghosh first author of the study and member of st johns college those chemical bonds are like tiny vibrating springs which are generally felt by electrons impairing the performance of molecules and devices however we have now found that certain molecules can avoid these detrimental effects when we restrict the geometric and electronic structure of the molecule to some special configurations to demonstrate these design principles the scientists designed a series of efficient nearinfrared emitting 680800 nm molecules in these molecules energy losses resulting from vibrationsessentially electrons dancing to the tune of atoms were more than 100 times lower than in previous organic molecules this understanding and development of new rules to design light emitting molecules has opened an extremely interesting trajectory for the future where these fundamental observations can be applied to industries these molecules also have a wide range of applications today the task now is to translate our discovery to make better technologies from enhanced displays to improved molecules for biomedical imaging and disease detection concluded professor akshay rao from cavendish laboratory who led this research reference decoupling excitons from highfrequency vibrations in organic molecules by pratyush ghosh antonios m alvertis rituparno chowdhury petri murto alexander j gillett shengzhi dong alexander j sneyd hwanhee cho emrys w evans bartomeu monserrat feng li christoph schnedermann hugo bronstein richard h friend and akshay rao 8 may 2024 nature doi 101038s4158602407246x,Physics
altermagnetic crystal not only the directions of spin polarization in magenta and cyan alternate on neighboring magnetic atoms but also the atomic shapes themselves  as shown by tilting the dumbbellshaped electron densities in two different directions the blue beamline illustrates the photoemission experiment on a synchrotron that was used to demonstrate altermagnetism credit libor mejkal und anna birk hellenes  jgu a recent study published in nature reveals that an international team of scientists has challenged the conventional division of magnetism into two types ferromagnetism known for thousands of years and antiferromagnetism identified roughly a century ago the researchers have now successfully demonstrated through direct experiments a third type of magnetismaltermagnetismwhich had been theoretically predicted by scientists from johannes gutenberg university mainz and the czech academy of sciences in prague several years earlier we usually think of a magnet as a ferromagnet which has a strong magnetic field that keeps a shopping list on the door of a refrigerator or enables the function of an electric motor in an electric car the magnetic field of a ferromagnet is created when the magnetic field of millions of its atoms is aligned in the same direction this magnetic field can also be used to modulate the electric current in information technology it components at the same time however the ferromagnetic field poses a serious limitation to the spatial and temporal scalability of the components thus a significant research focus in recent years has been on the second antiferromagnetic branch of magnets antiferromagnets are lesser known but much more common materials in nature where the directions of the atomic magnetic fields on adjacent atoms are staggered like white and black colors on a chessboard thus antiferromagnets as a whole do not create undesirable magnetic fields but unfortunately they are so antimagnetic that they have not yet found active applications in information technology recently predicted altermagnets combine the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets which were thought to be fundamentally incompatible and also have other unique benefits not found in the other branches altermagnets can be thought of as magnetic arrangements where not only the atomic moments on neighboring atoms alternate but also the orientation of the atoms in the crystal thus altermagnets do not create a magnetic field on the outside but the electrons inside feel a magnetic field that is effectively 1000 times stronger than the field of the magnet on the fridge these fields can modulate electric currents akin to ferromagnets and are thus potentially very attractive for applications in future ultrascalable nanoelectronics in addition scientists have identified more than 200 candidate materials for altermagnetism with properties covering insulators semiconductors metals and even superconductors research groups have investigated many of these materials in the past but their altermagnetic nature has remained hidden from them starting in 2019 a team from johannes gutenberg university mainz and the institute of physics in prague published a series of papers in which they theoretically identified unconventional magnetic materials in 2021 the same team of dr libor mejkal professor jairo sinova and professor tomas jungwirth predicted that these materials form a third fundamental type of magnetism which they termed altermagnetism and whose crystal and magnetic structure is completely different from conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets since altermagnetism opens up wide and unprecedented possibilities for research and application almost immediately after the theoretical prediction came a wave of followup studies by research groups from all over the world subsequently it was a question of when the direct experimental evidence would be forthcoming an international team of reseachers has now provided such evidence in a study published in nature the researchers decided to examine crystals of a simple twoelement altermagnetic candidate  manganese telluride mnte traditionally this material has been considered one of the classical antiferromagnets because the magnetic moments on neighboring manganese atoms point in opposite directions and so do not create an external magnetic field around the material now for the first time scientists have been able to directly demonstrate the altermagnetism of mnte they used theoretical predictions to navigate in which direction  the light would shine on highquality mnte crystals in a photoemission experiment the team measured the band structures which are maps physicists use to describe the properties of electrons in crystals on a synchrotron they were then able to show that despite the absence of an external magnetic field the electronic states in mnte are strongly spinsplit the scale and shape of the spin splitting correspond perfectly to the predicted altermagnetic splitting using quantum mechanical calculations additionally the researchers were able to detect spinpolarisation of the bands for the first time this is direct evidence that mnte is neither a conventional antiferromagnet nor a conventional ferromagnet but belongs to a new altermagnetic branch of magnetic materials said dr libor mejkal of jgu the main author of the theoretical part of the paper the study drew on the expertise of researchers at the institute of physics at johannes gutenberg university mainz in germany in collaboration with scientists from the czech academy of sciences in prague the paul scherrer institute in switzerland the university of west bohemia in pilsen the university of linz in austria the university of nottingham in the uk and charles university in prague after the first predictions and with the rapidly growing worldwide interest in altermagnetism we are delighted to have been able to contribute to the experimental demonstration in mnte said dr libor mejkal from mainz university professor jairo sinova director of the interdisciplinary spintronics research group inspire group and the spin phenomena interdisciplinary center spice at jgu and coauthor of the study added the discovery of altermagnetism has kickstarted new directions in global research into new physical and material principles for highly scalable and energyefficient it components remarkably the field is heating up and several other studies appeared recently confirming various other properties of altermagnetic materials the discovery of altermagnetism thus seems to be just the beginning of an exciting new era in magnetism reference altermagnetic lifting of kramers spin degeneracy by j krempask

researchers from mit and the university of basel have developed a new aidriven machinelearning framework to efficiently map out phase diagrams for unknown physical systems potentially revolutionizing the study of material properties and quantum systems credit scitechdailycom a new machinelearning framework from mit and the university of basel that can automatically classify phases of physical systems could help scientists investigate novel materials when water freezes it transitions from a liquid phase to a solid phase this results in drastic changes in properties such as density and volume while phase transitions in water are so common that most of us dont even think about them phase transitions in novel materials or complex physical systems are an important area of study to fully understand these systems scientists must be able to recognize phases and detect the transitions between them however quantifying phase changes in an unfamiliar system remains challenging particularly with limited data researchers from mit and the university of basel in switzerland applied generative artificial intelligence models to this problem developing a new machinelearning framework that can automatically map out phase diagrams for novel physical systems their physicsinformed machinelearning approach is more efficient than laborious manual techniques that rely on theoretical expertise importantly because their approach leverages generative models it does not require huge labeled training datasets used in other machinelearning techniques such a framework could help scientists investigate the thermodynamic properties of novel materials or detect entanglement in quantum systems for instance ultimately this technique could make it possible for scientists to discover unknown phases of matter autonomously if you have a new system with fully unknown properties how would you choose which observable quantity to study the hope at least with datadriven tools is that you could scan large new systems in an automated way and it will point you to important changes in the system this might be a tool in the pipeline of automated scientific discovery of new exotic properties of phases says frank schfer a postdoc in the julia lab in the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail and coauthor of a paper on this approach joining schfer on the paper are first author julian arnold a graduate student at the university of basel alan edelman applied mathematics professor in the department of mathematics and leader of the julia lab and senior author christoph bruder professor in the department of physics at the university of basel the research was published on may 16 in physical review letters while water transitioning to ice might be among the most obvious examples of a phase change more exotic phase changes like when a material transitions from being a normal conductor to a superconductor are of keen interest to scientists these transitions can be detected by identifying an order parameter a quantity that is important and expected to change for instance water freezes and transitions to a solid phase ice when its temperature drops below 0 degrees celsius in this case an appropriate order parameter could be defined in terms of the proportion of water molecules that are part of the crystalline lattice versus those that remain in a disordered state in the past researchers have relied on physics expertise to build phase diagrams manually drawing on theoretical understanding to know which order parameters are important not only is this tedious for complex systems and perhaps impossible for unknown systems with new behaviors but it also introduces human bias into the solution more recently researchers have begun using machine learning to build discriminative classifiers that can solve this task by learning to classify a measurement statistic as coming from a particular phase of the physical system the same way such models classify an image as a cat or dog the scientists demonstrated how generative models can be used to solve this classification task much more efficiently and in a physicsinformed manner the julia programming language a popular language for scientific computing that is also used in mits introductory linear algebra classes offers many tools that make it invaluable for constructing such generative models schfer adds generative models like those that underlie chatgpt and dalle typically work by estimating the probability distribution of some data which they use to generate new data points that fit the distribution such as new cat images that are similar to existing cat images however when simulations of a physical system using triedandtrue scientific techniques are available researchers get a model of its probability distribution for free this distribution describes the measurement statistics of the physical system the research teams insight is that this probability distribution also defines a generative model upon which a classifier can be constructed they plug the generative model into standard statistical formulas to directly construct a classifier instead of learning it from samples as was done with discriminative approaches this is a really nice way of incorporating something you know about your physical system deep inside your machinelearning scheme it goes far beyond just performing feature engineering on your data samples or simple inductive biases schfer says this generative classifier can determine what phase the system is in given some parameter like temperature or pressure and because the researchers directly approximate the probability distributions underlying measurements from the physical system the classifier has system knowledge this enables their method to perform better than other machinelearning techniques and because it can work automatically without the need for extensive training their approach significantly enhances the computational efficiency of identifying phase transitions at the end of the day similar to how one might ask chatgpt to solve a math problem the researchers can ask the generative classifier questions like does this sample belong to phase i or phase ii or was this sample generated at high temperature or low temperature scientists could also use this approach to solve different binary classification tasks in physical systems possibly to detect entanglement in quantum systems is the state entangled or not or determine whether theory a or b is best suited to solve a particular problem they could also use this approach to better understand and improve large language models like chatgpt by identifying how certain parameters should be tuned so the chatbot gives the best outputs in the future the mit team also wants to study theoretical guarantees regarding how many measurements they would need to effectively detect phase transitions and estimate the amount of computation that would be required reference mapping out phase diagrams with generative classifiers by julian arnold frank schfer alan edelman and christoph bruder 16 may 2024 physical review letters

quantum tunneling allows particles to bypass energy barriers a new method has been proposed to measure the time it takes for particles to tunnel which could challenge previous assertions of superluminal tunneling speeds this method involves using atoms as clocks to detect subtle time differences credit scitechdailycom in an amazing phenomenon of quantum physics known as tunneling particles appear to move faster than the speed of light however physicists from darmstadt believe that the time it takes for particles to tunnel has been measured incorrectly until now they propose a new method to stop the speed of quantum particles in classical physics there are strict laws that cannot be circumvented for instance if a rolling ball lacks sufficient energy it will not get over a hill instead it will roll back down before reaching the peak in quantum physics this principle is not quite so strict here a particle may pass a barrier even if it does not have enough energy to go over it it acts as if it is slipping through a tunnel which is why the phenomenon is also known as quantum tunneling far from mere theoretical magic this phenomenon has practical applications such as in the operation of flash memory drives in the past experiments in which particles tunneled faster than light drew some attention after all einsteins theory of relativity prohibits fasterthanlight velocities the question is therefore whether the time required for tunneling was stopped correctly in these experiments physicists patrik schach and enno giese from tu darmstadt follow a new approach to define time for a tunneling particle they have now proposed a new method of measuring this time in their experiment they measure it in a way that they believe is better suited to the quantum nature of tunneling they have published the design of their experiment in the renowned journal science advances according to quantum physics small particles such as atoms or light particles have a dual nature depending on the experiment they behave like particles or like waves quantum tunneling highlights the wave nature of particles a wave packet rolls towards the barrier comparable to a surge of water the height of the wave indicates the probability with which the particle would materialize at this location if its position were measured if the wave packet hits an energy barrier part of it is reflected however a small portion penetrates the barrier and there is a small probability that the particle will appear on the other side of the barrier previous experiments observed that a light particle has traveled a longer distance after tunneling than one that had a free path it would therefore have traveled faster than the light however the researchers had to define the location of the particle after its passage they chose the highest point of its wave packet but the particle does not follow a path in the classical sense objects enno giese it is impossible to say exactly where the particle is at a particular time this makes it difficult to make statements about the time required to get from a to b schach and giese on the other hand are guided by a quote from albert einstein time is what you read off a clock they suggest using the tunneling particle itself as a clock a second particle that does not tunnel serves as a reference by comparing these two natural clocks it is possible to determine whether time elapses slower faster or equally fast during quantum tunneling the wave nature of particles facilitates this approach the oscillation of waves is similar to the oscillation of a clock specifically schach and giese propose using atoms as clocks the energy levels of atoms oscillate at certain frequencies after addressing an atom with a laser pulse its levels initially oscillate synchronized  the atomic clock is started during tunneling however the rhythm shifts slightly a second laser pulse causes the two internal waves of the atom to interfere detecting the interference makes it possible to measure how far apart the two waves of the energy levels are which in turn is a precise measure of the elapsed time a second atom which does not tunnel serves as a reference to measure the time difference between tunneling and nontunneling calculations by the two physicists suggest that the tunneling particle will show a slightly delayed time the clock that is tunneled is slightly older than the other says patrik schach this seems to contradict experiments that attributed superluminal speed to tunneling in principle the test can be carried out with todays technology says schach but it is a major challenge for experimenters this is because the time difference to be measured is only around 1026 seconds  an extremely short time it helps to use clouds of atoms as clocks instead of individual atoms explains the physicist it is also possible to amplify the effect for example by artificially increasing the clock frequencies we are currently discussing this idea with experimental colleagues and are in contact with our project partners adds giese it is quite possible that a team will soon decide to carry out this exciting experiment reference a

an international research team has shown that phonons the quantum particles behind material vibrations can be classified using topology much like electronic bands in materials this breakthrough could lead to the development of new materials with unique thermal electrical and mechanical properties enhancing our understanding and manipulation of solidstate physics an international group of researchers has found that quantum particles which play a key role in the vibrations of materials affecting their stability and other characteristics can be classified through topology known as phonons these particles represent the collective vibrational patterns of atoms within a crystal structure they create disturbances that spread like waves to nearby atoms phonons are crucial for several properties of solids such as thermal and electrical conductivity neutron scattering and quantum states including charge density waves and superconductivity the spectrum of phononsessentially the energy as a function of momentumand their wave functions which represent their probability distribution in real space can be computed using ab initio first principle codes however these calculations have so far lacked a unifying principle for the quantum behavior of electrons topologya branch of mathematicshas successfully classified the electronic bands in materials this classification shows that materials which might seem different are actually very similar we already have catalogues of electronic topological behaviors akin to a periodic table of compounds naturally this led us to question can topology also characterize phonons explained b andrei bernevig a professor of physics at princeton university visiting professor at dipc and one of the studys authors in a study published in the journal science an international team from princeton university zhejiang university dipc enscnrs max planck institute and the university of the basque country uncovered that a wide range of materials could host topological phonons topology the study of properties preserved through continuous deformations is used to characterize manifolds for instance a mobius strip is distinguished from a regular strip by a twist and a doughnut differs from a sphere by a hole these cannot be transformed into each other without cutting the manifold we first computed the phonon bands of thousands of quantum materials identifying their wavefunctions and characterizing them by their symmetries which provide a sort of local structure of the phonons said yuanfeng xu the first author of the study and a professor at zhejiang university after completing this step we employed topology to classify the global behavior of the phonon bands he added several phonon structure databases have been meticulously analyzed revealing that at least half of the materials exhibit at least one nonatomic cumulative phononic band set the team employed a formalism similar to that developed for characterizing electronic bands as outlined in their previous work on topological quantum chemistry tqc an international team of scientists from the princeton university donostia international physics center dipc the university of the basque country upvehu the max planck institute lecole normale suprieure the cnrs and zhejiang university have scanned several phonon databases and predict the existence of topological phonons in approximately 5000 materials phonon offer a new avenue for achieving nontrivial band topologies in solidstate materials potentially leading to phonon surface states that could complement or enhance electronic surface states the robustness of the topological surface phonon states can be leveraged for applications like frequency filtering or mechanical energy attenuation under imperfect conditions as well as for heat transfer and infrared photoelectronics topological phonons could also pave the way for creating phonon diodes or acoustic waveguides explained nicolas regnault a professor at enscnrs and one of the corresponding authors of the study analyzing data from over ten thousand materials gathered from abinitio calculations and stored in databases like  and the materials project they found that 50 of materials exhibit at least one nontrivial gap the tools for these calculations are hosted on the bilbao crystallographic server luis elcoro a professor at the university of the basque country and another corresponding author informed once the symmetry eigenvalues of the bands are determined all types of symmetryindicated phonon topologies can be identified by these tools tqc has proven to be a universal formalism for identifying topological properties in lattices he added elcoro also mentioned that after developing the theory and implementing it in computer codes the topological diagnosis tools have been made publicly available on the website allowing anyone to verify reinterpret or expand upon our findings we discovered more topological structures in phonons than we initially expected and we anticipate that topological phonons will lead to rich and unconventional physics much like topological electrons have stated maia g vergniory a professor at dipc and max planck in dresden she emphasized the importance of validating predictions for materials hosting topological phonons noting that such experiments might be more challenging than those for electronic topology due to lack of direct imaging techniques the phonons have been cataloged in a public repository where researchers can access specific materials every phononic surface state is listed in this database the next step would be for experimentalists to measure them mentioned nicolas regnault highlighting the crucial role of experimental verification in advancing the field the team envisions new physics that may emerge from the coupling between topological electrons and phonons if topological electron surface states coexist with phononic ones this could facilitate strong electronphonon coupling on the surfacethough potentially not in the bulkpotentially leading to surface superconductivity we now must delve into understanding the influence of topology on electronphonon coupling concluded bernevig highlighting the next steps in their research reference catalog of topological phonon materials by yuanfeng xu m g

researchers at tu wien have created a method to study slow electrons in materials by using fast electrons challenging previous beliefs about electron interaction dynamics their findings which show slow electrons being released through individual collisions rather than cascades have significant implications for cancer treatment and microelectronics slow electrons are used in cancer therapy as well as in microelectronics however it is very hard to observe how they behave in solids but now scientists at tu wien have made this possible electrons can behave very differently depending on how much energy they have when electrons whether high or low energy are shot into a solid body they can produce various effects lowenergy electrons can contribute to cancer development but they can also be harnessed to destroy tumors they are also important in technology for example for the production of tiny structures in microelectronics these slow electrons however are extremely difficult to measure knowledge about their behavior in solid materials is limited and often scientists can only rely on trial and error however tu wien has now succeeded in obtaining valuable new information about the behavior of these electrons fast electrons are used to generate slow electrons directly in the material this allows details to be deciphered that were previously inaccessible experimentally the method has now been presented in the journal physical review letters we are interested in what the slow electrons do inside a material for example inside a crystal or inside a living cell says prof wolfgang werner from the institute of applied physics at tu wien to find out you would actually have to build a minilaboratory directly in the material to be able to measure directly on site but thats not possible of course felix bldorn julian brunner alessandra bellissimo florian simperl wolfgang werner credit tu wien you can only measure electrons that come out of the material but that doesnt tell you where in the material they were released and what has happened to them since then the team at tu wien solved this problem with the help of fast electrons that penetrate the material and stimulate various processes there for example these fast electrons can disturb the balance between the positive and negative electrical charges of the material which can then lead to another electron detaching itself from its place traveling at a relatively low speed and in some cases escaping from the material the crucial step now is to measure these different electrons simultaneously on the one hand we shoot an electron into the material and measure its energy when it leaves again on the other hand we also measure which slow electrons come out of the material at the same time and by combining this data it is possible to obtain information that was previously inaccessible the amount of energy that the fast electron has lost on its journey through the material provides information on how deeply it has penetrated the material this in turn provides information about the depth at which the slower electrons were released from their place this data can now be used to calculate to what extent and in what way the slow electrons in the material release their energy numerical theories on this can be reliably validated for the first time using the data this led to a surprise it was previously thought that the release of electrons in the material took place in a cascade a fast electron enters the material and hits another electron which is then ripped away from its place causing two electrons to move these two electrons would then remove two more electrons from their place and so on the new data show that this is not true instead the fast electron undergoes a series of collisions but always retains a large part of its energy and only one comparatively slow electron is detached from its place in each of these interactions our new method offers opportunities in very different areas says wolfgang werner we can now finally investigate how the electrons release energy in their interaction with the material it is precisely this energy that determines whether tumor cells can be destroyed in cancer therapy for example or whether the finest details of a semiconductor structure can be correctly formed in electron beam lithography reference energy dissipation of fast electrons in polymethylmethacrylate toward a universal curve for electronbeam attenuation in solids between 0 ev and relativistic energies by wolfgang s m werner florian simperl felix bldorn julian brunner johannes kero alessandra bellissimo and olga ridzel 1 may 2024 physical review letters doi 101103physrevlett132186203,Physics

a research team at the hzdr has succeeded in significantly increasing the acceleration of protons via laser pulse by using an innovative method credit hzdr  blaurock the helmholtzzentrum dresdenrossendorf hzdr has made a significant advance in laser plasma acceleration by employing an innovative method a research team managed to substantially exceed the previous record for proton acceleration for the first time they achieved energies that so far have only seemed possible at much larger facilities as the research group reported in the journal nature physics promising applications in medicine and materials science have now become much likelier laser plasma acceleration opens up interesting perspectives compared to conventional accelerators it holds the promise of more compact more energyefficient facilities  because instead of employing powerful radio waves to get particles moving the new technology uses lasers to accelerate them the principle is that extremely short but highintensity laser pulses fire on waferthin foils the light heats up the material to such an extent that countless electrons emerge from it while the atomic cores remain in place as the electrons are negatively charged and the atomic cores are positive a strong electric field is formed between them for a short time this field can catapult a proton pulse over only a few micrometers to energies that would require substantially longer distances using conventional accelerator technology this technology however is still at the research stage so far it has only been possible to achieve proton energies of up to 100 mev and only by using extremely large laser systems of which there are just a few in the world in order to achieve similarly high accelerator energies with smaller laser facilities and shorter pulses the team of hzdr physicists karl zeil and tim ziegler pursued a new approach they harness a property of laser flashes that is generally seen as a flaw a pulses energy doesnt kick in immediately which would be the ideal case reports ziegler instead a little of the laser energy rushes ahead of it like a kind of vanguard in the new concept it is this light rushing ahead that plays a key role when it hits a specially manufactured plastic foil in a vacuum chamber it can change it in a specific way the foil expands due to the influence of the light and gets ever hotter and thinner ziegler explains the foil effectively melts during the heating process this has a positive impact on the primary pulse which follows on immediately the foil which would otherwise largely reflect the light suddenly becomes transparent which allows the primary pulse to penetrate more deeply into the material than it did in previous experiments the result is that a complex cascade of acceleration mechanisms is triggered in the material says ziegler causing the protons contained in the film to be accelerated much more than they were by our draco laser in figures whereas the facility previously achieved proton energies of approximately 80 mev it can now generate 150 mev  almost double to achieve this record the team had to conduct a series of experiments to approach the perfect interaction parameters for example regarding the optimum thickness of the films used when analyzing the measurement data the research group discovered that the accelerated particle beam had another pleasing property the highenergy protons exhibit a narrow energy distribution meaning that figuratively speaking they are all about equally fast  an advantageous feature for later applications  for which high uniform proton energies are extremely beneficial one of these applications is to investigate new radiobiological concepts for precise gentle tumor treatment using this method very high doses of radiation are applied for a very short period for these studies up to now largescale conventional therapy accelerators have mainly been used which are only available at a few centers in germany and which are of course prioritized for patient treatment the new hzdr procedure now renders the use of compact laser systems more likely enabling additional research groups to access these investigations and facilitate radiation scenarios that conventional systems cannot deliver moreover todays facilities need a lot of power says ziegler based on laser plasma acceleration they could be much more economical the procedure could also be used for the efficient generation of neutrons the laser flashes can be employed to produce short intense neutron pulses which are of interest for use in science and technology as well as for materials analysis here too plasma accelerators promise to significantly expand the previous fields of application but first of all the scientists want to refine the new method and understand it better among other things they want to cooperate with other laboratories to control the process more precisely and make the technology more available further records are also on the agenda energies of more than 200 mev seem entirely possible reference laserdriven highenergy proton beams from cascaded acceleration regimes

scientists have developed a new technique using ultrafast terahertz pulses to control atomic motion in twodimensional semiconductors promising advancements in highspeed computing and electronic device development semiconductors are a cornerstone of nextgeneration technology so a new method to excite atoms in semiconductor materials is likely to excite a broad range of researchers and industries as well by leveraging intense and broadband ultrafast terahertz pulses scientists from yokohama national university and their colleagues at the california institute of technology have demonstrated atomic excitation in a twodimensional semiconductor material advancing the development of electronic devices their paper was published on march 19 and appears as an editors pick in the journal applied physics letters twodimensional 2d materials or sheetlike nanomaterials are promising platforms for future semiconductor applications due to their unique electronic properties transition metal dichalcogenides tmds a prominent group of 2d materials consist of layers of transition metal atoms sandwiched between layers of chalcogen atoms arranged in a lattice structure these atoms can vibrate or oscillate around their equilibrium positions  this collective excitation is known as a coherent phonon and plays a crucial role in determining and controlling material properties traditionally coherent phonons are induced by ultrashort pulsed lasers in the visible and nearinfrared regions methods using other light sources remain limited our study addresses the fundamental question of how coherent phonons are induced by ultrafast terahertz frequency lasers  or lowenergy photons  in tmd materials said satoshi kusaba an assistant professor at the graduate school of engineering science of yokohama national university and first author of the study schematics of the ultrafast broadband terahertz excitation and polarization rotation detection of phonon in wse2 obtained result lower right includes the coherent phonon oscillation signal excited via sumfrequency process upper right credit satoshi kusaba  yokohama national university terahertz radiation refers to electromagnetic waves with frequencies in the terahertz range between microwave and infrared frequencies the research team prepared ultrafast broadband terahertz pulses to induce coherent phonon dynamics in thin films of a tmd called wse2 a precise and sensitive setup was arranged for detecting optical anisotropy in other words how light behaves when it passes through the material the researchers investigated the changes in the orientation of the electric field of ultrashort laser pulses as they interact with the material these changes are known as polarization rotation by carefully observing the small induced optical anisotropy the team succeeded in detecting the phonon signals induced by the terahertz pulses the most important finding from our study is that terahertz excitation can induce coherent phonons in tmds through a distinct sumfrequency excitation process said hawwei lin a phd candidate at the california institute of technology at the time of research and cofirst author of this study this mechanism which is fundamentally different from resonant and linear absorption processes involves the combined energy of two terahertz photons matching that of the phonon mode since the symmetry of the phonon modes that can be excited via this sumfrequency process is completely different from that of the more typical resonant linear process the excitation process successfully used in this study is important for fully controlling atomic motions in materials the implications of the studys findings extend beyond fundamental research holding promise for a variety of realworld applications with the sum frequency excitation process we can coherently control twodimensional atomic positions using terahertz excitation kusaba said this could open the door for controlling the electronic states of tmds which is promising for the development of valleytronics and electronic devices using tmds for low powerconsumption highspeed computing and specialized light sources reference terahertz sumfrequency excitation of coherent optical phonons in the twodimensional semiconductor wse2 by satoshi kusaba hawwei lin ryo tamaki ikufumi katayama jun takeda and geoffrey a blake 19 march 2024 applied physics letters doi 10106350191558 the study was funded by the ministry of education of taiwan the national science foundation nasa and the japan society for the promotion of science other contributors include ryo tamaki ikufumi katayama and jun takada from yokohama national university geoffrey a blake from california institute of technology,Physics
researchers at tu wien have innovated a cooling technique for quantum experiments by controlling fluctuations in a boseeinstein condensate significantly improving quantum simulators for studying intricate quantum physics quantum experiments whether they focus on quantum computers quantum teleportation or novel quantum sensors consistently face a common challenge quantum effects are highly fragile and easily disrupted they are extremely sensitive to external disturbances  for example to fluctuations caused simply by the surrounding temperature it is therefore important to be able to cool down quantum experiments as effectively as possible at tu wien vienna it has now been shown that this type of cooling can be achieved in an interesting new way a boseeinstein condensate is split into two parts neither abruptly nor particularly slowly but with a very specific temporal dynamic that ensures that random fluctuations are prevented as perfectly as possible in this way the relevant temperature in the already extremely cold boseeinstein condensate can be significantly reduced this is important for quantum simulators which are used at tu wien to gain insights into quantum effects that could not be investigated using previous methods we work with quantum simulators in our research says maximilian prfer who is researching new methods at tu wiens atomic institute with the help of an esprit grant from the fwf quantum simulators are systems whose behavior is determined by quantum mechanical effects and which can be controlled and monitored particularly well these systems can therefore be used to study fundamental phenomena of quantum physics that also occur in other quantum systems which cannot be studied so easily tiantian zhang and maximilian prfer credit tu wien this means that a physical system is used to actually learn something about other systems this idea is not entirely new in physics for example you can also carry out experiments with water waves in order to learn something about sound waves  but water waves are easier to observe in quantum physics quantum simulators have become an extremely useful and versatile tool in recent years says maximilian prfer among the most important tools for realizing interesting model systems are clouds of extremely cold atoms such as those we study in our laboratory in the current paper published in physical review x the scientists led by jrg schmiedmayer and maximilian prfer investigated how quantum entanglement evolves over time and how this can be used to achieve an even colder temperature equilibrium than before quantum simulation is also a central topic in the recently launched quanta cluster of excellence in which various quantum systems are being investigated the decisive factor that usually limits the suitability of such quantum simulators at present is their temperature the better we cool down the interesting degrees of freedom of the condensate the better we can work with it and the more we can learn from it says maximilian prfer there are different ways to cool something down for example you can cool a gas by increasing its volume very slowly with extremely cold boseeinstein condensates other tricks are typically used the most energetic atoms are quickly removed until only a collection of atoms remains which have a fairly uniformly low energy and are therefore cooler but we use a completely different technique says tiantian zhang first author of the study who investigated this topic as part of her doctoral thesis at the doctoral college of the vienna center for quantum science and technology we create a boseeinstein condensate and then split it into two parts by creating a barrier in the middle the number of particles which end up on the right side and on the left side of the barrier is undetermined due to the laws of quantum physics there is a certain amount of uncertainty here one could say that both sides are in a quantumphysical superposition of different particle number states on average exactly 50 of the particles are on the left and 50 on the right says maximilian prfer but quantum physics says that there are always certain fluctuations the fluctuations ie the deviations from the expected value are closely related to the temperature the research team at tu wien was able to show neither an extremely abrupt nor an extremely slow splitting of the boseeinstein condensate is optimal a compromise must be found a cleverly tailored way to dynamically split the condensate in order to control the quantum fluctuations as well as possible this cannot be calculated this problem cannot be solved using conventional computers but with experiments the research team was able to show the appropriate splitting dynamics can be used to suppress the fluctuation in the number of particles and this in turn translates into a reduction the temperature that you want to minimize different temperature scales exist simultaneously in this system and we lower a very specific one of them explains maximilian prfer so you cant think of it like a minifridge that gets noticeably colder overall but thats not what were talking about suppressing the fluctuations is exactly what we need to be able to use our system as a quantum simulator even better than before we can now use it to answer questions from fundamental quantum physics that were previously inaccessible reference squeezing oscillations in a multimode bosonic josephson junction by tiantian zhang mira maiwger filippo borselli yevhenii kuriatnikov jrg schmiedmayer and

princeton plasma physics laboratory researchers have innovatively combined electron cyclotron current drive and resonant magnetic perturbations to improve plasma control in fusion processes potentially reducing fusion energy costs and overcoming challenges associated with edgelocalized modes credit scitechdailycom researchers successfully simulate a novel combination method for managing fusion plasma in their ongoing quest to develop a range of methods for managing plasma so it can be used to generate electricity in a process known as fusion researchers at the us department of energys doe princeton plasma physics laboratory pppl have shown how two old methods can be combined to provide greater flexibility while the two methods  known as electron cyclotron current drive eccd and applying resonant magnetic perturbations rmp  have long been studied this is the first time researchers have simulated how they can be used together to give enhanced plasma control this is kind of a new idea said qiming hu a staff research physicist at pppl and lead author of a new paper published in the journal nuclear fusion about the work which has also been demonstrated experimentally the full capabilities are still being figured out but our paper does a great job of advancing our understanding of the potential benefits ultimately scientists hope to use fusion to generate electricity first they will need to overcome several hurdles including perfecting methods for minimizing bursts of particles from the plasma that are known as edgelocalized modes elms periodically these bursts release a little bit of pressure because its too much but these bursts can be dangerous said hu who works for pppl at the diiid national fusion facility a doe user facility hosted by general atomics diiid is a tokamak a device that uses magnetic fields to confine a fusion plasma in a donut shape elms can end a fusion reaction and even damage the tokamak so researchers have developed many ways to try to avoid them the best way weve found to avoid them is by applying resonant magnetic perturbations or rmps that generate additional magnetic fields said pppl principal research physicist alessandro bortolon who was one of the coauthors of the paper an artistic representation of magnetic islands credit kyle palmer  pppl communications department the magnetic fields initially applied by the tokamak wind around the torusshaped plasma both the long way  around the outer edge and the short way  from the outer edge and through the center hole the additional magnetic fields created by the rmps travel through the plasma weaving in and out like a sewers stitch these fields produce oval or circular magnetic fields in the plasma called magnetic islands normally islands in plasmas are really really bad if the islands are too big then the plasma itself can disrupt however the researchers already knew experimentally that under certain conditions the islands can be beneficial the hard part is generating rmps big enough to generate the islands thats where the eccd which is basically a microwave beam injection comes in the researchers found that adding eccd to the plasmas edge lowers the amount of current required to generate the rmps necessary to make the islands the image on the left shows the tokamak and 3d magnetic perturbation generated by 3d coils with the purpleblue hues representing lower amplitude perturbations and the red representing higher amplitude perturbations the image on the right is a closer view showing the top half of the tokamak and plasma the coils are used to generate the magnetic field perturbations that produce the islands blue another coil can also be found on the bottom of the machine the injection system for the eccd microwaves is depicted on top red these can be used to adjust the width of the islands credit qiming hu  pppl the microwave beam injection also allowed the researchers to perfect the size of the islands for maximum plasma edge stability metaphorically the rmps act like a simple light switch that turns the islands on while the eccd acts like an additional dimmer switch that lets the researchers adjust the islands to the ideal size for a manageable plasma our simulation refines our understanding of the interactions in play hu said when the eccd was added in the same direction as the current in the plasma the width of the island decreased and the pedestal pressure increased applying the eccd in the opposite direction produced opposite results with island width increasing and pedestal pressure dropping or facilitating island opening the research is also notable because eccd was added to the plasmas edge instead of the core where it is typically used usually people think applying localized eccd at the plasma edge is risky because the microwaves may damage invessel components said hu weve shown that its doable and weve demonstrated the flexibility of the approach this might open new avenues for designing future devices by lowering the amount of current required to generate the rmps this simulation work could ultimately lead to lowering the cost of fusion energy production in commercialscale

researchers have developed a method to quantify quantum entanglement using normalized entanglement witnesses in various experimental scenarios this advancement allows for the estimation of lower bounds on entanglement measures and can differentiate between entangled and separable states more effectively credit scitechdailycom a new method quantifies quantum entanglement using normalized entanglement witnesses enhancing the ability to measure entanglement across different scenarios prof sixia yu associate researcher liangliang sun and xiang zhuo from the university of science and technology of china ustc of the chinese academy of sciences cas in collaboration with prof xu zhenpeng from anhui university ahu and armin tavakoli from lund university proposed an approach to quantify entanglement using the standard entanglement witness procedure under three common experimental scenarios their work was published recently in physical review letters two fundamental tasks in quantum entanglement research are detection and quantification of entanglement entanglement witnesses ews which are observable quantities that are negative for entangled states and positive for separable states are widely used to detect entanglement under various experimental scenarios for its simplicity and strong detection capabilities up to now ews have only been used to detect the presence of entanglement remaining silent on estimating the amount of entanglement present in the state this team filled this research gap by discovering that ew can be normalized into a trace distance that characterizes the distinguishability between experimental data generated by a given entangled state and by a separable state under identical measurements the distinguishability is the core of entanglement quantifier and can be used to bound a variety of common entanglement measures in the scenario of trusted devices the normalized ew characterizes the optimal distinguishability between the given state and separable state in the deviceindependent di scenario the normalized ew quantifies the optimal distinguishability between the quantum correlations generated by the given state and the local correlations generated by a separable state similar normalization of the ew is achieved in the measurementdeviceindependent mdi scenario this entanglement quantifier enables researchers to estimate the lower bounds of various entanglement measures based on the mean value of the ews regardless of the experimental scenario ews are no longer silent on the quantification of entanglement furthermore for multipartite systems the normalized ews can be leveraged to estimate the entanglement depth which is the minimum number of entangled particles when the number of particles approaches infinity this method provides a rigorous lower bound that asymptotically tends to the exact value of entanglement the reviewers highly praised this work saying that it comprehensively addressed an important issue enabling entanglement experiments to encompass a broader range of entanglement measures reference bounding the amount of entanglement from witness operators by liangliang sun xiang zhou armin tavakoli zhenpeng xu and sixia yu 12 march 2024 physical review letters doi 101103physrevlett132110204,Physics
caltech researchers have discovered that quantum mechanical effects can cause barkhausen noise a phenomenon in magnetism traditionally understood as classical this finding observed through experiments at temperatures near absolute zero suggests significant quantum behavior and potential technological applications in materials with trillions of spins credit scitechdailycom iron screws and other socalled ferromagnetic materials are made up of atoms with electrons that act like little magnets normally the orientations of the magnets are aligned within one region of the material but are not aligned from one region to the next think of packs of tourists in times square pointing to different billboards all around them but when a magnetic field is applied the orientations of the magnets or spins in the different regions line up and the material becomes fully magnetized this would be like the packs of tourists all turning to point at the same sign the process of spins lining up however does not happen all at once rather when the magnetic field is applied different regions or socalled domains influence others nearby and the changes spread across the material in a clumpy fashion scientists often compare this effect to an avalanche of snow where one small lump of snow starts falling pushing on other nearby lumps until the entire mountainside of snow is tumbling down in the same direction this avalanche effect was first demonstrated in magnets by the physicist heinrich barkhausen in 1919 by wrapping a coil around a magnetic material and attaching it to a loudspeaker he showed that these jumps in magnetism can be heard as a crackling sound known today as barkhausen noise now reporting in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences pnas caltech researchers have shown that barkhausen noise can be produced not only through traditional or classical means but through quantum mechanical effects this is the first time quantum barkhausen noise has been detected experimentally the research represents an advance in fundamental physics and could one day have applications in creating quantum sensors and other electronic devices barkhausen noise is the collection of the little magnets flipping in groups says christopher simon lead author of the paper and a postdoctoral scholar in the lab of thomas f rosenbaum a professor of physics at caltech the president of the institute and the sonja and william davidow presidential chair we are doing the same experiment that has been done many times but we are doing it in a quantum material we are seeing that the quantum effects can lead to macroscopic changes usually these magnetic flips occur classically through thermal activation where the particles need to temporarily gain enough energy to jump over an energy barrier however the new study shows that these flips can also occur quantum mechanically through a process called quantum tunneling christopher simon holds a crystal of lithium holmium yttrium fluoride credit lance hayashidacaltech in tunneling particles can jump to the other side of an energy barrier without having to actually pass over the barrier if one could scale up this effect to everyday objects like golf balls it would be like the golf ball passing straight through a hill rather than having to climb up over it to get to the other side in the quantum world the ball doesnt have to go over a hill because the ball or rather the particle is actually a wave and some of it is already on the other side of the hill says simon in addition to quantum tunneling the new research shows a cotunneling effect in which groups of tunneling electrons are communicating with each other to drive the electron spins to flip in the same direction classically each one of the mini avalanches where groups of spins flip would happen on its own says coauthor daniel silevitch research professor of physics at caltech but we found that through quantum tunneling two avalanches happen in sync with each other this is a result of two large ensembles of electrons talking to each other and through their interactions they make these changes this cotunneling effect was a surprise for their experiments members of the team used a pink crystalline material called lithium holmium yttrium fluoride cooled to temperatures near absolute zero equivalent to minus 27315 degrees celsius they wrapped a coil around it applied a magnetic field and then measured brief jumps in voltage not unlike what barkhausen did in 1919 in his more simplified experiment the observed voltage spikes indicate when groups of electron spins flip their magnetic orientations as the groups of spins flip one after the other a series of voltage spikes is observed ie the barkhausen noise by analyzing this noise the researchers were able to show that a magnetic avalanche was taking place even without the presence of classical effects specifically they showed that these effects were insensitive to changes in the temperature of the material this and other analytical steps led them to conclude that quantum effects were responsible for the sweeping changes according to the scientists these flipping regions can contain up to 1 million billion spins in comparison to the entire crystal that contains approximately 1 billion trillion spins we are seeing this quantum behavior in materials with up to trillions of spins ensembles of microscopic objects are all behaving coherently rosenbaum says this work represents the focus of our lab to isolate quantum mechanical effects where we can quantitively understand what is going on another recent pnas paper from rosenbaums lab similarly looks at how tiny quantum effects can lead to largerscale changes in this earlier study the researchers studied the element chromium and showed that two different types of charge modulation involving the ions in one case and the electrons in the other operating at different length scales can interfere quantum mechanically people have studied chromium for a long time says rosenbaum but it took until now to appreciate this aspect of the quantum mechanics it is another example of engineering simple systems to reveal quantum behavior that we can study on the macroscopic scale reference quantum barkhausen noise induced by domain wall cotunneling by c simon dm silevitch pce stamp and tf rosenbaum

researchers at michigan state university have created five new isotopes simulating conditions similar to those in neutron star collisions advancing our knowledge of cosmic nuclear processes artists concept credit scitechdailycom an international research team at the facility for rare isotope beams frib at michigan state university has successfully created five new isotopes bringing the stars closer to earth the isotopes  known as thulium182 thulium183 ytterbium186 ytterbium187 and lutetium190  were reported feb 15 in the journal physical review letters these represent the first batch of new isotopes made at frib a user facility for the us department of energy office of science or doesc supporting the mission of the doesc office of nuclear physics the new isotopes show that frib is nearing the creation of nuclear specimens that currently only exist when ultradense celestial bodies known as neutron stars crash into each other thats the exciting part said alexandra gade professor of physics at frib and in msus department of physics and astronomy and frib scientific director we are confident we can get even closer to those nuclei that are important for astrophysics gade is also a cospokesperson of the project which was led by oleg tarasov senior research physicist at frib the research team included a cohortbased at frib and msu along with collaborators at the institute for basic science in south korea and at riken in japan an acronym that translates to the institute of physical and chemical research this is probably the first time these isotopes have existed on the surface of the earth said bradley sherrill university distinguished professor in msus college of natural science and head of the advanced rare isotope separator department at frib for an explanation as to what advanced means in this context sherrill said that researchers needed only a couple of individual particles of a new isotope to confirm its existence and identity using fribs stateoftheart instruments with researchers now knowing how to make these new isotopes they can start making them in greater quantities to conduct experiments that were never possible before the researchers are also eager to follow the path theyve forged to make more new isotopes that are even more like what are found in the stars i like to draw the analogy of taking a journey weve been looking forward to going somewhere weve never been before and this is the first step sherrill said weve left home and were starting to explore our sun is a cosmic atomic factory its powerful enough to take the cores of two hydrogen atoms or nuclei and fuse them into one helium nucleus hydrogen and helium are the first and lightest entries on the periodic table of the elements getting to the heavier elements on the table requires even more intense environments than whats found in the sun scientists hypothesize that elements like gold  about 200 times as massive as hydrogen  are created when two neutron stars merge neutron stars are the leftover cores of exploded stars that were originally much larger than our sun but not so much larger that they can become black holes in their final acts although theyre not black holes neutron stars still cram an immense amount of mass into a very modest size theyre about the size of lansing with the mass of our sun sherrill said its not certain but people think that all of the gold on earth was made in neutron star collisions by making isotopes that are present at the site of a neutron star collision scientists could better explore and understand the processes involved in making these heavy elements the five new isotopes are not part of that milieu but they are the closest scientists have come to reaching that special territory  and the outlook for finally reaching it is very good to create the new isotopes the team sent a beam of platinum ions barreling into a carbon target the beam current divided by the charge state was 50 nanoamps since these experiments were performed frib has already scaled its beam power up to 350 nanoamps and has plans to reach up to 15000 nanoamps in the meantime the new isotopes are exciting in and of themselves presenting the nuclear research community new opportunities to step into the unknown its not a big surprise that these isotopes exist but now that we have them we have colleagues who will be very interested in what we can measure next gade said im already starting to think of what we can do next in terms of measuring their halflives their masses and other properties researching these quantities in isotopes that have never been available before will help inform and refine our understanding of fundamental nuclear science theres so much more to learn sherrill said and were on our way

quantum teleportation researchers have developed a method to improve teleportation quality in noisy conditions by using hybrid entanglement of photons achieving nearly perfect state transfers credit scitechdailycom researchers succeeded in conducting an almost perfect quantum teleportation despite the presence of noise that usually disrupts the transfer of quantum state in teleportation the state of a quantum particle or qubit is transferred from one location to another without sending the particle itself this transfer requires quantum resources such as entanglement between an additional pair of qubits in an ideal case the transfer and teleportation of the qubit state can be done perfectly however realworld systems are vulnerable to noise and disturbances  and this reduces and limits the quality of the teleportation researchers from the university of turku finland and the university of science and technology of china hefei have now proposed a theoretical idea and made corresponding experiments to overcome this problem in other words the new approach enables reaching highquality teleportation despite the presence of noise the work is based on an idea of distributing entanglement  prior to running the teleportation protocol  beyond the used qubits ie exploiting the hybrid entanglement between different physical degrees of freedom says professor jyrki piilo from the university of turku conventionally the polarization of photons has been used for the entanglement of qubits in teleportation while the current approach exploits the hybrid entanglement between the photons polarization and frequency this allows for a significant change in how the noise influences the protocol and as a matter of fact our discovery reverses the role of the noise from being harmful to being beneficial to teleportation piilo describes with conventional qubit entanglement in the presence of noise the teleportation protocol does not work in a case where there is initially hybrid entanglement and no noise the teleportation does not work either however when we have hybrid entanglement and add noise the teleportation and quantum state transfer occur in almost perfect manner says dr olli siltanen whose doctoral dissertation presented the theoretical part of the current research in general the discovery enables almost ideal teleportation despite the presence of certain type of noise when using photons for teleportation while we have done numerous experiments on different facets of quantum physics with photons in our laboratory it was very thrilling and rewarding to see this very challenging teleportation experiment successfully completed says dr zhaodi liu from the university of science and technology of china hefei this is a significant proofofprinciple experiment in the context of one of the most important quantum protocols says professor chuanfeng li from the university of science and technology of china hefei teleportation has important applications eg in transmitting quantum information and it is of utmost importance to have approaches that protect this transmission from noise and can be used for other quantum applications the results of the current study can be considered as basic research that carries significant fundamental importance and opens intriguing pathways for future work to extend the approach to general types of noise sources and other quantum protocols reference overcoming noise in quantum teleportation with multipartite hybrid entanglement by zhaodi liu olli siltanen tom kuusela ruiheng miao chenxi ning chuanfeng li guangcan guo and jyrki piilo 1 may 2024 science advances doi 101126sciadvadj3435,Physics
a team from the university of massachusetts amherst together with collaborators from the university of chicago have successfully modified a microwave circulator to precisely manage nonreciprocity between a quantum bit and a microwaveresonant cavity marking a significant advancement in quantum computing artists concept credit scitechdailycom researchers have made a significant advancement in quantum computing by adapting a microwave circulator to precisely control the nonreciprocity between a qubit and a resonant cavity this innovation not only enhances the control within quantum computers but also simplifies the theoretical models for future research scientists led by the university of massachusetts amherst have adapted a device called a microwave circulator for use in quantum computers allowing them for the first time to precisely tune the exact degree of nonreciprocity between a qubit the fundamental unit of quantum computing and a microwaveresonant cavity the ability to precisely tune the degree of nonreciprocity is an important tool to have in quantum information processing in doing so the team including collaborators from the university of chicago derived a general and widely applicable theory that simplifies and expands upon older understandings of nonreciprocity so that future work on similar topics can take advantage of the teams model even when using different components and platforms the research was published recently in science advances the nonreciprocal device with its circulator center qubit port superconducting cavity and output port credit umass amherst quantum computing differs fundamentally from the bitbased computing we all do every day a bit is a piece of information typically expressed as a 0 or a 1 bits are the basis for all the software websites and emails that make up our electronic world by contrast quantum computing relies on quantum bits or qubits which are like regular bits except that they are represented by the quantum superposition of two states of a quantum object matter in a quantum state behaves very differently which means that qubits arent relegated to being only 0s or 1sthey can be both at the same time in a way that sounds like magic but which is well defined by the laws of quantum mechanics this property of quantum superposition leads to the increased power capabilities of quantum computers furthermore a property called nonreciprocity can create additional avenues for quantum computing to leverage the potential of the quantum world imagine a conversation between two people says sean van geldern graduate student in physics at umass amherst and one of the papers authors total reciprocity is when each of the people in that conversation is sharing an equal amount of information nonreciprocity is when one person is sharing a little bit less than the other this is desirable in quantum computing says senior author chen wang assistant professor of physics at umass amherst because there are many computing scenarios where you want to give plenty of access to data without giving anyone the power to alter or degrade that data to control nonreciprocity lead author yingying wang graduate student in physics at umass amherst and her coauthors ran a series of simulations to determine the design and properties their circulator would need to have in order for them to vary its nonreciprocity they then built their circulator and ran a host of experiments not just to prove their concept but to understand exactly how their device enabled nonreciprocity in the course of doing so they were able to revise their model which contained 16 parameters detailing how to build their specific device to a simpler and more general model of only six parameters this revised more general model is much more useful than the initial more specific one because it is widely applicable to a range of future research efforts the integrated nonreciprocal device that the team built looks like a y at the center of the y is the circulator which is like a traffic roundabout for the microwave signals mediating the quantum interactions one of the legs is the cavity port a resonant superconducting cavity hosting an electromagnetic field another leg of the y holds the qubit printed on a sapphire chip the final leg is the output port if we vary the superconducting electromagnetic field by bombarding it with photons says yingying wang we see that that qubit reacts in a predictable and controllable way which means that we can adjust exactly how much reciprocity we want and the simplified model that we produced describes our system in such a way that the external parameters can be calculated to tune an exact degree of nonreciprocity this is the first demonstration of embedding nonreceptivity into a quantum computing device says chen wang and it opens the door to engineering more sophisticated quantum computing hardware reference dispersive nonreciprocity between a qubit and

artist impression of the bosonic kitaev chain multiple mechanical string resonators are linked to form a chain using light mechanical vibrations sound waves are transported and amplified along the chain credit ella maru studio researchers at amolf working alongside colleagues from germany switzerland and austria have realized a new type of metamaterial through which sound waves flow in an unprecedented fashion it provides a novel form of amplification of mechanical vibrations which has the potential to improve sensor technology and information processing devices this metamaterial is the first instance of a socalled bosonic kitaev chain which gets its special properties from its nature as a topological material it was realized by making nanomechanical resonators interact with laser light through radiation pressure forces the discovery which is published on march 27 in the renowned scientific journal nature was achieved in an international collaboration between amolf the max planck institute for the science of light the university of basel eth zurich and the university of vienna the kitaev chain is a theoretical model that describes the physics of electrons in a superconducting material specifically a nanowire the model is famous for predicting the existence of special excitations at the ends of such a nanowire majorana zero modes these have gained intense interest because of their possible use in quantum computers amolf group leader ewold verhagen we were interested in a model that looks mathematically identical but describes waves like light or sound instead of electrons since such waves consist of bosons photons or phonons rather than fermions electrons their behavior is expected to be very different nonetheless in 2018 it was predicted that a bosonic kitaev chain exhibits fascinating behavior that is not known of any natural material nor of any metamaterial to date while many scientists were interested experimental realization remained elusive the bosonic kitaev chain is essentially a chain of coupled resonators it is a metamaterial ie a synthetic material with engineered properties the resonators can be thought of as the atoms of a material and the way they are coupled together controls the collective metamaterial behavior in this case the propagation of sound waves along the chain the couplings  the links of the bosonic kitaev chain  need to be special and cant be made with regular springs for example says first author of the nature paper jesse slim who graduated cum laude last year we realized that we could experimentally create the required links between nanomechanical resonators  small vibrating silicon strings on a chip  by coupling them with the help of forces exerted by light thus creating optical springs carefully varying the intensity of a laser over time then allowed linking five resonators and implementing the bosonic kitaev chain the result was striking the optical coupling mathematically resembles the superconducting links in the fermionic kitaev chain says verhagen but uncharged bosons do not exhibit superconductivity instead optical coupling adds amplification to the nanomechanical vibrations as a result sound waves which are the mechanical vibrations propagating through the array are exponentially amplified from one end to the other interestingly in the opposite direction transmission of vibrations is forbidden and even more intriguing if the wave is delayed a bit  by a quarter of an oscillation period  the behavior is completely inverted the signal is amplified backward and blocked forwards the bosonic kitaev chain thus acts like a unique type of directional amplifier which could have interesting applications for signal manipulation in particular in quantum technology the interesting properties of majorana zero modes in the electronic kitaev chain are linked to the fact that the material is topological in topological materials certain phenomena are invariably connected to the general mathematical description of the material those phenomena are then topologically protected meaning that they are guaranteed to exist even if the material suffers from defects and perturbations the understanding of topological materials was awarded the nobel prize of physics in 2016 but this encompassed only materials that do not feature amplification or damping the description of topological phases that do include amplification is still a topic of intense research and debate together with theory collaborators clara wanjura max planck institute for the science of light matteo brunelli university of basel javier del pino eth zurich and andreas nunnenkamp university of vienna the amolf researchers showed that the bosonic kitaev chain is in fact a new topological phase of matter the observed directional amplification is a topological phenomenon associated with this phase of matter as the theory collaborators predicted in 2018 they demonstrated a unique experimental signature of the topological nature of the metamaterial if the chain is closed such that it forms a necklace amplified sound waves in the ring of resonators keep circulating and reach a very high intensity similar to how strong light beams are generated in lasers verhagen because of topological protection the amplification is in principle insensitive to disturbances but interestingly the chain is in fact extra sensitive to one particular type of disturbance if the frequency of the last resonator on the chain is slightly perturbed the amplified signals along the chain can suddenly travel backward again experiencing amplification a second time the result is that the system is very sensitive to such a small perturbation which could be caused by the mass of a molecule adhering to the resonator or a qubit interacting with it with the erc consolidator grant that he recently acquired verhagen wants to investigate the possibilities to enhance the sensitivity of nanomechanical sensors in these systems we have seen the first indications of the sensing capabilities in our experiments which is very exciting we now need to investigate in more detail how these topological sensors work whether the sensitivity is boosted in the presence of various types of noise sources and which interesting sensor technologies can benefit from these principles this is just the beginning of that endeavor reference optomechanical realization of the bosonic kitaev chain by jesse j slim clara c wanjura matteo brunelli javier del pino andreas nunnenkamp and ewold verhagen 27

argonne national laboratory scientists have used anomaly detection in the atlas collaboration to search for new particles identifying a promising anomaly that could indicate new physics beyond the standard model credit scitechdailycom argonne national laboratory scientists have used anomaly detection in the atlas collaboration to search for new particles identifying a promising anomaly that could indicate new physics beyond the standard model scientists used a neural network a type of braininspired machine learning algorithm to sift through large volumes of particle collision data in a study that marks the first use of a neural network to analyze data from a collider experiment particle physicists are tasked with mining this massive and growing store of collision data for evidence of undiscovered particles in particular theyre searching for particles not included in the standard model of particle physics our current understanding of the universes makeup that scientists suspect is incomplete a schematic representation of the architecture used for training and analysis the neural network is given an image as input and tries to recreate it large differences between input and output images indicate potential deviations from the standard model credit atlas collaboration as part of the atlas collaboration scientists at the us department of energys doe argonne national laboratory and their colleagues recently used a machine learning approach called anomaly detection to analyze large volumes of atlas data the method has never before been applied to data from a collider experiment it has the potential to improve the efficiency of the collaborations search for something new the collaboration involves scientists from 172 research organizations the team leveraged a braininspired type of machine learning algorithm called a neural network to search the data for abnormal features or anomalies the technique breaks from more traditional methods of searching for new physics it is independent of  and therefore unconstrained by  the preconceptions of scientists rather than looking for very specific deviations the goal is to find unusual signatures in the data that are completely unexplored and that may look different from what our theories predict  physicist sergei chekanov traditionally atlas scientists have relied on theoretical models to help guide their experiment and analysis in the directions most promising for discovery this often involves performing complex computer simulations to determine how certain aspects of collision data would look according to the standard model scientists compare these standard model predictions to real data from atlas they also compare them to predictions made by new physics models like those attempting to explain dark matter and other phenomena unaccounted for by the standard model but so far no deviations from the standard model have been observed in the billions of billions of collisions recorded at atlas and since the discovery of the higgs boson in 2012 the atlas experiment has yet to find any new particles anomaly detection is a very different way of approaching this search said sergei chekanov a physicist in argonnes high energy physics division and a lead author on the study rather than looking for very specific deviations the goal is to find unusual signatures in the data that are completely unexplored and that may look different from what our theories predict to perform this type of analysis the scientists represented each particle interaction in the data as an image that resembles a qr code then the team trained their neural network by exposing it to 1 of the images the network consists of around 2 million interconnected nodes which are analogous to neurons in the brain without human guidance or intervention it identified and remembered correlations between pixels in the images that characterize standard model interactions in other words it learned to recognize typical events that fit within standard model predictions atlas event display for one of eight events contributing to the largest deviation from standard model predictions found by the neural network in this study credit cern after training the scientists fed the other 99 of the images through the neural network to detect any anomalies when given an image as input the neural network is tasked with recreating the image using its understanding of the data as a whole if the neural network encounters something new or unusual it gets confused and has a hard time reconstructing the image said chekanov if there is a large difference between the input image and the output it produces it lets us know that there might be something interesting to explore in that direction using computational resources at argonnes laboratory computing resource center the neural network analyzed around 160 million events within lhc run2 data collected from 2015 to 2018 although the neural network didnt find any glaring signs of new physics in this data set it did spot one anomaly that the scientists think is worth further study an exotic particle decay at an energy of around 48 teraelectronvolts results in a muon a type of fundamental particle and a jet of other particles in a way that does not fit with the neural networks understanding of standard model interactions well have to do more investigation said chekanov it is likely a statistical fluctuation but theres a chance this decay could indicate the existence of an undiscovered particle the team plans to apply this technique to data collected during the lhc run3 period which began in 2022 atlas scientists will continue to explore the potential of machine learning and anomaly detection as tools for charting unknown territory in particle physics the results of the study were published in physical review letters reference search for new phenomena in twobody invariant mass distributions using unsupervised

researchers have developed a new atomic clock method using superradiant atoms which promises unprecedented precision in time measurement this advancement could improve gps accuracy aid in space navigation and enhance volcanic and earthquake monitoring credit scitechdailycom superradiant atoms offer a groundbreaking method for measuring time with an unprecedented level of precision in a recent study published by the scientific journal nature communications researchers from the university of copenhagen present a new method for measuring the time interval seconds that overcomes some of the limitations that even todays most advanced atomic clocks encounter this advancement could have broad implications in areas such as space exploration volcanic monitoring and gps systems the second which is the most precisely defined unit of measurement is currently measured by atomic clocks in different places around the world that together tell us what time it is using radio waves atomic clocks continuously send signals that synchronize our computers phones and watches oscillations are the key to keeping time in a grandfather clock these oscillations are from a pendulums swinging from side to side every second while in an atomic clock it is a laser beam that corresponds to an energy transition in strontium and oscillates about a million billion times per second the luminous ball in the middle called a magnetooptical trap mot consists of approximately 300 million strontium atoms suspended in a vacuum chamber cooled to just above absolute zero this trap was used by researchers to develop new techniques for measuring time credit eliot bohr however according to phd fellow eliot bohr from the niels bohr institute even atomic clocks could become more precise this is because the detection laser used by most modern atomic clocks to read the oscillation of atoms heats up the atoms so much that they escape thus degrading precision because the atoms constantly need to be replaced with fresh new atoms while new atoms are being prepared the clock loses time ever so slightly therefore we are attempting to overcome some of the current challenges and limitations of the worlds best atomic clocks by among other things reusing the atoms so that they dont need to be replaced as often explains bohr who was employed at the niels bohr institute when he did the research but who is now phd fellow at the university of colorado the current methodology consists of a hot oven that spits roughly 300 million strontium atoms into an extraordinarily chilly ball of cold atoms known as a magnetooptical trap or mot the temperature of these atoms is approximately 273 c  very near absolute zero  and there are two mirrors with a light field in between them to enhance the atomic interactions bohr and his research colleagues developed a new method to read out the atoms when the atoms land in the vacuum chamber they lie completely still because it is so cold which makes it possible to register their oscillations with the two mirrors at opposing ends of the chamber explains bohr eliot bohr left and colleague sofus laguna kristensen starting the experiments at the niels bohr institute credit ola j joensen nbi the reason why the researchers dont need to heat the atoms with a laser and destroy them is thanks to a quantum physical phenomenon known as superradiance the phenomenon occurs when the group of strontium atoms is entangled and at the same time emits light in the field between the two mirrors the mirrors cause the atoms to behave as a single unit collectively they emit a powerful light signal that we can use to read out the atomic state a crucial step for measuring time this method heats up the atoms minimally so it all happens without replacing the atoms and this has the potential to make it a more precise measurement method explains bohr according to bohr the new research result may be beneficial for developing a more accurate gps system the roughly 30 satellites that constantly circle earth and tell us where we are need atomic clocks to measure time whenever satellites determine the position of your phone or gps you are using an atomic clock in a satellite the precision of the atomic clocks is so important that if that atomic clock is off by a microsecond it means an inaccuracy of about 100 meters on the earths surface said bohr more precise atomic clocks could also have a significant impact on future space missions when people and crafts are sent out into space they venture even further away from our satellites consequently the requirements for precise time measurements to navigate in space are much greater he says the result could also be helpful in the development of a new generation of smaller portable atomic clocks that could be used for more than just measuring time atomic clocks are sensitive to gravitational changes and can therefore be used to detect changes in earths mass and gravity and this could help us predict when volcanic eruptions and earthquakes will occur says bohr although very promising bohr emphasizes that this new method of using superradiant atoms is still a proof of concept

physicists at slac national accelerator laboratory are exploring a new method to detect dark matter using quantum devices focusing on a lesserknown form called thermalized dark matter their approach involves utilizing quantum sensors traditionally disrupted by unexplained energy intrusions to potentially detect dark matters subtle energy impacts this innovative research leverages the unique capabilities of quantum technology to potentially solve the longstanding mystery of dark matter detection credit scitechdailycom since its discovery dark matter has continued to elude detection by scientists even with the deployment of multiple ultrasensitive particle detector experiments around the world over several decades now physicists at the department of energys doe slac national accelerator laboratory are proposing a new way to look for dark matter using quantum devices which might be naturally tuned to detect what researchers call thermalized dark matter most dark matter experiments hunt for galactic dark matter which rockets into earth directly from space but another kind might have been hanging around earth for years said slac physicist rebecca leane who was an author on the new study dark matter goes into the earth bounces around a lot and eventually just gets trapped by the gravitational field of the earth leane said bringing it into an equilibrium scientists refer to as thermalized over time this thermalized dark matter builds up to a higher density than the few loose galactic particles meaning that it could be more likely to hit a detector unfortunately thermalized dark matter moves much more slowly than galactic dark matter meaning it would impart far less energy than galactic dark matter  likely too little for traditional detectors to see with that in mind leane and slac postdoctoral fellow anirban das reached out to noah kurinsky a staff scientist at slac and leader of a new lab focused on detecting dark matter with quantum sensors who had been thinking about a puzzle even when superconductors are cooled to absolute zero removing all of the energy out of the system and creating a stable quantum state somehow energy reenters and disrupts the quantum state typically scientists assume thats because of imperfect cooling systems or some source of heat in the environment said kurinksy but there could be another reason he said what if we actually have a perfectly cold system and the reason we cant cool it down effectively is because its constantly being bombarded by dark matter das kurinsky and leane wondered whether superconducting quantum devices could be redesigned as thermalized dark matter detectors according to their calculations the minimum energy needed to activate a quantum sensor is low enough  around onethousandth of an electron volt  that it could detect lowenergy galactic dark matter as well as thermalized dark matter particles hanging around earth of course that doesnt mean that dark matter is to blame for disrupted quantum devices  only that it is possible the next step leane and kurinsky said is to figure out if and how they can turn sensitive quantum devices into dark matter detectors with that there are a few things to consider for starters maybe there is a better material to make the device out of we were looking at aluminum to start with and thats just because thats probably the bestcharacterized material thats been used for detectors so far said leane but it could turn out that for the sort of mass range were looking at and the sort of detector we want to use maybe theres a better material theres also a possibility that thermalized dark matter wouldnt interact with a quantum device the same way galactic dark matter is suspected to interact with direct detection devices leane said in this study we were just thinking about a simple case for dark matter coming in and bouncing straight off the detector but it could do a lot of other things for example other particles could interact with dark matter that change the way the particles in the detector are distributed this is one of the great things about being at slac leane says we really have quite a diverse range of groups working on a lot of different science and i feel like this project is a really nice synergy of the research at slac reference dark matter induced power in quantum devices by anirban das noah kurinsky and rebecca k leane 22 march 2024 physical review letters doi 101103physrevlett132121801 the research was funded by the doe office of science,Physics
atoms inside of an optical cavity exchange their momentum states by playing catch with photons as the atoms absorb photons from an applied laser the whole cloud of atoms recoil rather than the individual atoms credit steven burrowsrey thompson and holland groups edited  researchers at jila and nist have developed a technique to mitigate atomic recoil in quantum measurements by using momentumexchange interactions within a cavity system this breakthrough could significantly enhance the accuracy of quantum sensors and enable new quantum physics discoveries due to atomic recoil precisely measuring the energy states of individual atoms has been a historical challenge for physicists when an atom interacts with a photon the atom recoils in the opposite direction making it difficult to measure the position and momentum of the atom precisely this recoil can have big implications for quantum sensing which detects minute changes in parameters for example using changes in gravitational waves to determine the shape of the earth or even detect dark matter jila and nist fellows ana maria rey and james thompson jila fellow murray holland and their teams proposed a way to overcome this atomic recoil by demonstrating a new type of atomic interaction called momentumexchange interaction where atoms exchanged their momentums by exchanging corresponding photons details of the research have been published in a new paper in the journal science using a cavityan enclosed space composed of mirrorsthe researchers observed that the atomic recoil was dampened by atoms exchanging energy states within the confined space this process created a collective absorption of energy and dispersed the recoil among the entire population of particles atoms inside of an optical cavity exchange their momentum states by playing catch with photons as the atoms absorb photons from an applied laser the whole cloud of atoms recoil rather than the individual atoms credit steven burrowsholland rey and thompson groups with these results other researchers can design cavities to dampen recoil and other outside effects in a wide range of experiments which can help physicists better understand complex systems or discover new aspects of quantum physics an improved cavity design could also enable more precise simulations of superconductivity such as in the case of the boseeinsteincondensatebardeencooperschrift becbcs crossover or highenergy physical systems for the first time the momentumexchange interaction was observed to induce oneaxis twisting oat dynamics an aspect of quantum entanglement between atomic momentum states oat acts like a quantum braid for entangling different molecules as each quantum state gets twisted and connected to another particle previously oat was only seen in atomic internal states but now with these new results it is thought that oat induced by momentum exchange could help reduce quantum noise from multiple atoms being able to entangle momentum states could also lead to improvement in some physical measurements by quantum sensors such as gravitational waves within this new study inspired by previous research from thompson and his team the researchers examined the effects of quantum superposition which allows particles like photons or electrons to exist in multiple quantum states simultaneously in this new project the atoms all share the same spinlabel the only difference is that each atom is in a superposition between two momentum states graduate student and first author chengyi luo explained the researchers found they could better control atomic recoil by forcing the atoms to exchange photons and their associated energies similar to a game of dodgeball one atom may throw a dodgeball a photon and recoil in the opposite direction that dodgeball may be caught by a second atom which can cause the same amount of recoil for this second atom this cancels out the two recoils experienced by both atoms and averages them for the entire cavity system when two atoms exchange their different photon energies the resulting wave packet an atoms wave distribution in superposition forms a momentum graph known as a density grating which looks like a finetoothed comb luo added the formation of the density grating indicates two momentum states within the atom are coherent with each other such that they could interfere with each other the researchers found that the exchange of photons between atoms caused a binding of the two atoms wave packets so they were no longer separate measurements the researchers could induce momentum exchange by exploring the interplay between the density grating and the optical cavity because the atoms exchanged energy any recoil from absorbing a photon was dispersed among the entire community of atoms instead of individual particles using this new control method the researchers found that they could also use this recoildampening system to help mitigate a separate measurement problem the doppler shift the doppler shift a phenomenon in classical physics explains why the sound of a siren or train horn changes pitch as it passes a listener or why certain stars appear red or blue in night sky imagesits the change in the frequency of the wave as the source and observer move toward or away from each other in quantum physics the doppler shift describes a particles energy change due to relative motion for researchers like luo the doppler shift can be a challenge to overcome in getting a precise measurement when absorbing photons the atomic recoil will lead to a doppler shift of the frequency of the photon which is a big problem when you talk about precision spectroscopy he elaborated by simulating their new method the researchers found that it could overcome measurement skewing due to doppler shift the researchers also found that the momentum exchange between these atoms could be used as a type of quantum entanglement as john wilson a graduate student in the holland group elaborated as an atom falls its motion wiggles the cavity frequency that in turn encourages other atoms to collectively feel that feedback mechanism and nudges them to correlate their motion through the shared wobbles to test this entanglement even further the researchers created a bigger separation between the momentum states of the atoms and then induced the momentum exchange the researchers found that the atoms continued to behave as if they were connected this indicates that the two momentum states are really oscillating concerning each other as if being connected by a spring added luo looking ahead the researchers plan to probe this new form of quantum entanglement further hoping to better understand how it can be used to improve various types of quantum devices reference momentumexchange interactions in a bragg atom interferometer suppress doppler dephasing by chengyi luo haoqing zhang vanessa p w koh john d wilson anjun chu murray j

the cheerios effect is a process where small floating objects cluster together on the surface of a liquid researchers optimized this process to increase condensation rates for efficient waterharvesting systems credit 2024 kaust ivan gromicho a more efficient way to capture fresh water from the air could be inspired by a phenomenon of motion first glimpsed in bowls of breakfast cereal kaust researchers have observed that when water droplets condense from the air onto a cold surface coated with oil the droplets commence a complex dance this motion  akin to a process known as the cheerios effect whereby the floating cereal tends to cluster due to surface tension  could help to speed up the harvesting of water from the atmosphere in arid regions such as saudi arabia we are interested in designing surfaces that can promote condensation of water which has important heattransfer and waterharvesting applications says marcus lin a research fellow in the lab of dan daniel who led the research on a typical solid surface condensed droplets stick to the surface with minimal motion think of water condensing on a cold soda can says lin the droplets only move once they grow big enough for gravity to pull them down daniel lin and their collaborators had the idea that adding a thin film of oil would lubricate the surface resulting in highly mobile droplets that would free up space for further droplet condensation boosting condensation rates the idea worked  but the complex ways in which the droplets moved was a complete surprise daniel says once the droplets grew to a critical size they began to move across the oil in a distinct pattern akin to an elaborate dance they initially moved in a serpentine manner before transitioning into circular motions and then back again says lin these motions occurred across scales ranging from micrometers to several centimeters and they lasted for hours researchers captured water droplets exhibiting complex collective motion oscillating between serpentine and circular motions as they condense on a thin oily film credit 2024 kaust fauzia wardani the driving force for the process is that  like cheerios in milk  water droplets floating on the oil are drawn toward their neighbors the larger droplets motion is driven by energy released as they swallow up smaller droplets in their path the moving droplets redistribute the oil film and switch from a serpentine to a circular motion when the film becomes locally depleted once the local oil rebuilds the snakelike dance resumes such devices that can efficiently capture water from the air by simple condensation with no energy input are widely sought as pressure grows on freshwater sources daniel says by optimizing the collective motion of condensing droplets we can greatly increase condensation rates and hence design more efficient waterharvesting systems he says the team plans to further explore the mechanisms driving droplet motion particularly investigating the transition from serpentine to circular movement another key aspect is to explore potential applications particularly in heattransfer enhancement and water harvesting lin adds reference emergent collective motion of selfpropelled condensate droplets by marcus lin philseok kim sankara arunachalam rifan hardian solomon adera joanna aizenberg xi yao and dan daniel 1 february 2024 physical review letters doi 101103physrevlett132058203,Physics
a new study suggests an experimental method to test gravitys quantum aspects without needing to entangle massive objects potentially advancing the field significantly credit scitechdailycom a proposed experiment shows that quantum entanglement is not the only way to test whether gravity has a quantum nature gravity is part of our everyday life still the gravitational force remains mysterious to this day we do not understand whether its ultimate nature is geometrical as einstein envisaged or governed by the laws of quantum mechanics until now all experimental proposals to answer this question have relied on creating the quantum phenomenon of entanglement between heavy macroscopic masses but the heavier an object is the more it tends to shed its quantum features and become classical making it incredibly challenging to make a heavy mass behave as a quantum particle in a study published in physical review x researchers from amsterdam and ulm propose an experiment that circumvents these issues successfully combining quantum mechanics and gravitational physics is one of the main challenges of modern science generally speaking progress in this area is hindered by the fact that we cannot yet perform experiments in regimes where both quantum and gravitational effects are relevant at a more fundamental level as nobel prize laureate roger penrose once put it we do not even know whether a combined theory of gravity and quantum mechanics will require a quantization of gravity or a gravitation of quantum mechanics in other words is gravity fundamentally a quantum force its properties being determined at the smallest possible scales or is it a classical force for which a largescale geometrical description suffices or is it something different yet it has always seemed that to answer these questions a central role would be played by the typically quantum phenomenon of entanglement as ludovico lami mathematical physicist at the university of amsterdam and qusoft puts it the central question initially posed by richard feynman in 1957 is to understand whether the gravitational field of a massive object can enter a socalled quantum superposition where it would be in several states at the same time prior to our work the main idea to decide this question experimentally was to look for gravitationally induced entanglement  a way in which distant but related masses could share quantum information the existence of such entanglement would falsify the hypothesis that the gravitational field is purely local and classical a drawing of the torsion balance used by henry cavendish in 1797 to measure the strength of gravity similar harmonic oscillators can now be used to reveal the quantumness of gravity the main problem with the previous proposals is that distant but related massive objects  known as delocalized states  are very challenging to create the heaviest object for which quantum delocalization has been observed to date is a large molecule much lighter than the smallest source mass whose gravitational field has been detected which is just below 100 mg  more than a billion billion times heavier this pushed any hope of an experimental realization decades away in the new work lami and his colleagues from amsterdam and ulm  interestingly the place where einstein was born  present a possible way out of this deadlock they propose an experiment that would reveal the quantumness of gravity without generating any entanglement lami we design and investigate a class of experiments involving a system of massive harmonic oscillators  for example torsion pendula essentially like the one that cavendish used in his famous 1797 experiment to measure the strength of the gravitational force we establish mathematically rigorous bounds on certain experimental signals for quantumness that a local classical gravity should not be able to overcome we have carefully analysed the experimental requirements needed to implement our proposal in an actual experiments and find that even though some degree of technological progress is still needed such experiments could really be within reach soon surprisingly to analyze the experiment the researchers still need the mathematical machinery of entanglement theory in quantum information science how is that possible lami the reason is that although entanglement is not physically there it is still there in spirit  in a precise mathematical sense it is enough that entanglement could have been generated the paper in which lami and colleagues explain their findings was published in physical review x this week the researchers hope that their paper is only the beginning and that their proposal will help design experiments that may answer the fundamental question about the quantumness of gravity much earlier than expected reference testing the quantumness of gravity without entanglement by ludovico lami julen s pedernales and martin b plenio 1 may 2024 physical review x doi 101103physrevx14021022,Physics

ie the quantum metric  was detected as an electric signal distinct from ordinary electrical conduction this breakthrough reveals the fundamental quantum science of electrons and paves the way for designing innovative spintronic devices utilizing the unconventional conduction emerging from the quantum metric the researchers breakthrough reveals the fundamental quantum science of electrons and paves the way for designing innovative spintronic devices credit tohoku university details were published in the journal nature physics on april 22 2024 electric conduction which is crucial for many devices follows ohms law a current responds proportionally to applied voltage but to realize new devices scientists have had to find a means to go beyond this law here is where quantum mechanics come in a unique quantum geometry known as the quantum metric can generate nonohmic conduction this quantum metric is a property inherent to the material itself suggesting that its a fundamental characteristic of the materials quantum structure the term quantum metric draws its inspiration from the metric concept in general relativity which explains how the geometry of the universe distorts under the influence of intense gravitational forces such as those around black holes similarly in the pursuit of designing nonohmic conduction within materials comprehending and harnessing the quantum metric becomes imperative this metric delineates the geometry of the electron universe analogous to the physical universe specifically the challenge lies in manipulating the quantummetric structure within a single device and discerning its impact on electrical conduction at room temperature left movement of light in a strong gravitational field in the universe middle nonohmic conduction arising

accompanied by a trivial quantummetric structure credit jiahao han yasufumi araki and shunsuke fukami the research team reported successful manipulation of the quantummetric structure at room temperature in a thinfilm heterostructure comprising an exotic magnet mn3sn and a heavy metal pt mn3sn exhibits essential magnetic texture when adjacent to pt which is drastically modulated by an applied magnetic field they detected and magnetically controlled a nonohmic conduction termed the secondorder hall effect where voltage responds orthogonally and quadratically to the applied electric current through theoretical modeling they confirmed that the observations can be exclusively described by the quantum metric our secondorder hall effect arises from the quantummetric structure that couples with the specific magnetic texture at the mn3snpt interface hence we can flexibly manipulate the quantum metric by modifying the magnetic structure of the material through spintronic approaches and verify such manipulation in the magnetic control of the secondorder hall effect explained jiahao han the lead author of this study in a hall bar device of mn3snpt under a magnetic field

researchers at the university of amsterdam have applied a 40yearold mathematical framework by jean calle to effectively describe and unify quantum mechanical tunneling phenomena credit scitechdailycom researchers have successfully used 40yearold mathematics to explain quantum tunneling providing a unified approach to diverse quantum phenomena quantum mechanical effects such as radioactive decay or more generally tunneling display intriguing mathematical patterns two researchers at the university of amsterdam now show that a 40yearold mathematical discovery can be used to fully encode and understand this structure in the quantum world processes can be separated into two distinct classes one class that of the socalled perturbative phenomena is relatively easy to detect both in an experiment and in a mathematical computation examples are plentiful the light that atoms emit the energy that solar cells produce the states of qubits in a quantum computer these quantum phenomena depend on plancks constant the fundamental constant of nature that determines how the quantum world differs from our largescale world but in a simple way despite the ridiculous smallness of this constant  expressed in everyday units of kilograms meters and seconds it takes a value that starts at the 34th decimal place after the comma  the fact that plancks constant is not exactly zero is enough to compute such quantum effects then there are the nonperturbative phenomena one of the bestknown is radioactive decay a process where due to quantum effects elementary particles can escape the attractive force that ties them to atomic nuclei if the world were classical  that is if plancks constant were exactly zero  this attractive force would be impossible to overcome in the quantum world decay does occur but still only occasionally a single uranium atom for example would on average take over four billion years to decay the collective name for such rare quantum events is tunneling for the particle to escape it has to dig a tunnel through the energy barrier that keeps it tied to the nucleus a tunnel that can take billions of years to dig and makes the shawshank redemption look like childs play mathematically nonperturbative quantum effects are much more difficult to describe than their perturbative cousins still over the century that quantum mechanics has existed physicists have found many ways to deal with these effects and to describe and predict them accurately still in this centuryold problem there was work left to be done says alexander van spaendonck one of the authors of the new publication the descriptions of tunneling phenomena in quantum mechanics needed further unification  a framework in which all such phenomena could be described and investigated using a single mathematical structure surprisingly such a structure was found in 40yearold mathematics in the 1980s french mathematician jean calle had set up a framework that he dubbed resurgence and that had precisely this goal giving structure to nonperturbative phenomena so why did it take 40 years for the natural combination of calles formalism and the application to tunneling phenomena to be taken to their logical conclusion marcel vonk the other author of the publication explains calles original papers were lengthy  over 1000 pages all combined  highly technical and only published in french as a result it took until the mid2000s before a significant number of physicists started getting familiar with this toolbox of resurgence originally it was mostly applied to simple toy models but of course the tools were also tried on reallife quantum mechanics our work takes these developments to their logical conclusion that conclusion is that one of the tools in calles toolbox that of a transseries is perfectly suited to describe tunneling phenomena in essentially any quantum mechanics problem and does so always in the same way by spelling out the mathematical details the authors found that it became possible not only to unify all tunneling phenomena into a single mathematical object but also to describe certain jumps in how big the role of these phenomena is  an effect known as stokes phenomenon van spaendonck using our description stokes phenomenon we were able to show that certain ambiguities that had plagued the classical methods of computing nonperturbative effects  infinitely many in fact  all dropped out in our method the underlying structure turned out to be even more beautiful than we originally expected the transseries that describes quantum tunneling turns out to split  or factorize  in a surprising way into a minimal transseries that describes the basic tunneling phenomena that essentially exist in any quantum mechanics problem and an object that we call the median transseries that describes the more problemspecific details and that depends for example on how symmetric a certain quantum setting is with this mathematical structure completely clarified the next question is of course where the new lessons can be applied and what physicists can learn from them in the case of radioactivity for example some atoms are stable whereas others decay in other physical models the lists of stable and unstable particles may vary as one slightly changes the setup  a phenomenon known as wallcrossing what the researchers have in mind next is to clarify this notion of wallcrossing using the same techniques this difficult problem has again been studied by many groups in many different ways but now a similar unifying structure might be just around the corner there is certainly light at the end of the tunnel reference exact instanton transseries for quantum mechanics by alexander van spaendonck and marcel vonk 12 april 2024 scipost

researchers have demonstrated how to manipulate light at nanoscale using photonic crystals simulating the effects of magnetic fields on electrons this breakthrough in photon manipulation can significantly impact the development of nanophotonic chips improving devices like lasers and quantum light sources artists concept credit scitechdailycom amolf researchers in collaboration with delft university of technology succeeded in bringing light waves to a halt by deforming the twodimensional photonic crystal that contains them the researchers showed that even a subtle deformation can have a substantial effect on photons in the crystal this resembles the effect that a magnetic field has on electrons this principle offers a new approach to slow down light fields and thereby enhance their strength realizing this on a chip is particularly important for many applications says amolfgroup leader ewold verhagen the researchers published their findings in the scientific journal nature photonics on april 23rd simultaneously a research team from pennsylvania state university published an article in this journal about how they demonstrated  independently from the dutch team  an identical effect manipulating the flow of light in a material at small scales is beneficial for the development of nanophotonic chips for electrons such manipulation can be realized using magnetic fields the lorentz force steers the motion of electrons however this is impossible for photons because they do not have charge researchers in the photonic forces group at amolf are looking for techniques and materials that would enable them to apply forces to photons that resemble the effects of magnetic fields we looked for inspiration at the way in which electrons behave in materials in a conductor electrons can in principle move freely but an external magnetic field can stop this the circular movement caused by the magnetic field stops conduction and as such electrons can only exist in the material if they have very specific energies these energy levels are called landau levels and they are characteristic for electrons in a magnetic field says verhagen but in the twodimensional material graphene  that consists of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a crystal  these landau levels can also be caused by a different mechanism than a magnetic field in general graphene is a good electronic conductor but this changes when the crystal array is deformed for instance by stretching it like elastics such mechanical deformation stops conduction the material turns into an insulator and consequently the electrons are bound to landau levels hence the deformation of graphene has a similar effect on electrons in a material as a magnetic field even without a magnet we asked ourselves if a similar approach would also work for photons electron microscopy image of a photonic crystal the diameter of the triangular holes is 300 nanometer the curvature of the crystal array stops the light waves in the crystal from moving credit amolf in a collaboration with kobus kuipers of delft university of technology the group of verhagen indeed demonstrated a similar effect for light in a photonic crystal a photonic crystal normally consists of a regular  two dimensional  pattern of holes in a silicon layer light can move freely in this material just like electrons in graphene says first author ren barczyk who successfully defended his phd thesis on this topic last year breaking this regularity in exactly the right manner will deform the array and consequently lock the photons this is how we create landau levels for photons in landau levels light waves no longer move they do not flow through the crystal but stand still the researchers succeeded in demonstrating this showing that the deformation of the crystal array has a similar effect on photons as a magnetic field on electrons verhagen stated by playing with the deformation pattern we even managed to establish various types of effective magnetic fields in one material as a result photons can move through certain parts of the material but not in others hence these insights also provide new ways to steer light on a chip the work of verhagen and his team was inspired by theoretical predictions of researchers at pennsylvania state university and columbia university verhagen recalls when we were doing our first measurements i happened to speak to one of the authors of this other study when it turned out that they were also looking for experimental evidence of the effect we decided not to compete in being first to publish but instead to submit the work simultaneously to the publisher while some details in the approach differed both teams were able to stop light waves from moving and observe landau levels by deforming a twodimensional photonic crystal this brings onchip applications closer says verhagen if we can confine light at the nanoscale and bring it to a halt like this its strength will be enhanced tremendously and not only at one location but over the entire crystal surface such light concentration is very important in nanophotonic devices for example for the development of efficient lasers or quantum light sources reference observation of landau levels and chiral edge states in photonic crystals through pseudomagnetic fields induced by synthetic strain by

galaxy cluster left with ring of dark matter visible right credit nasa esa m j jee and h ford johns hopkins university explorations in dark matter are advancing with new experimental techniques designed to detect axions leveraging advanced technology and interdisciplinary collaboration to uncover the secrets of this elusive component of the cosmos a ghost is haunting our universe this has been known in astronomy and cosmology for decades observations suggest that about 85 of all the matter in the universe is mysterious and invisible these two qualities are reflected in its name dark matter several experiments have aimed to unveil what its made of but despite decades of searching scientists have come up short now our new experiment under construction at yale university in the us is offering a new tactic dark matter has been around the universe since the beginning of time pulling stars and galaxies together invisible and subtle it doesnt seem to interact with light or any other kind of matter in fact it has to be something completely new the standard model of particle physics is incomplete and this is a problem we have to look for new fundamental particles surprisingly the same flaws of the standard model give precious hints on where they may hide lets take the neutron for instance it makes up the atomic nucleus along with the proton despite being neutral overall the theory states that it it made up of three charged constituent particles called quarks because of this we would expect some parts of the neutron to be charged positively and others negatively this would mean it was having what physicists call an electric dipole moment yet many attempts to measure it have come with the same outcome it is too small to be detected another ghost and we are not talking about instrumental inadequacies but a parameter that has to be smaller than one part in ten billion it is so tiny that people wonder if it could be zero altogether in physics however the mathematical zero is always a strong statement in the late 70s particle physicists roberto peccei and helen quinn and later frank wilczek and steven weinberg tried to accommodate theory and evidence they suggested that maybe the parameter is not zero rather it is a dynamical quantity that slowly lost its charge evolving to zero after the big bang theoretical calculations show that if such an event happened it must have left behind a multitude of light sneaky particles these were dubbed axions after a detergent brand because they could clear up the neutron problem and even more if axions were created in the early universe they have been hanging around since then most importantly their properties check all the boxes expected for dark matter for these reasons axions have become one of the favorite candidate particles for dark matter axions would only interact with other particles weakly however this means they would still interact a bit the invisible axions could even transform into ordinary particles including  ironically  photons the very essence of light this may happen in particular circumstances like in the presence of a magnetic field this is a godsend for experimental physicists many experiments are trying to evoke the axionghost in the controlled environment of a lab some aim to convert light into axions for instance and then axions back into light on the other side of a wall at present the most sensitive approach targets the halo of dark matter permeating the galaxy and consequently earth with a device called a haloscope it is a conductive cavity immersed in a strong magnetic field the former captures the dark matter surrounding us assuming it is axions while the latter induces the conversion into light the result is an electromagnetic signal appearing inside the cavity oscillating with a characteristic frequency depending on the axion mass the system works like a receiving radio it needs to be properly adjusted to intercept the frequency we are interested in practically the dimensions of the cavity are changed to accommodate different characteristic frequencies if the frequencies of the axion and the cavity do not match it is just like tuning a radio on the wrong channel the powerful magnet is moved to the lab at yale credit yale university unfortunately the channel we are looking for cannot be predicted in advance we have no choice but to scan all the potential frequencies it is like picking a radio station in a sea of white noise  a needle in a haystack  with an old radio that needs to be bigger or smaller every time we turn the frequency knob yet those are not the only challenges cosmology points to tens of gigahertz as the latest promising frontier for axion search as higher frequencies require smaller cavities exploring that region would require cavities too small to capture a meaningful amount of signal new experiments are trying to find alternative paths our axion longitudinal plasma haloscope alpha experiment uses a new concept of cavity based on metamaterials metamaterials are composite materials with global properties that differ from their constituents  they are more than the sum of their parts a cavity filled with conductive rods gets a characteristic frequency as if it were one million times smaller while barely changing its volume that is exactly what we need plus the rods provide a builtin easyadjustable tuning system we are currently building the setup which will be ready to take data in a few years the technology is promising its development is the result of the collaboration among solidstate physicists electrical engineers particle physicists and even mathematicians despite being so elusive axions are fuelling progress that no ghost will ever take away written by andrea

icfo researchers have discovered a new method to control electron valleys in bulk materials potentially revolutionizing the way information is encoded and manipulated in computing and quantum technologies artistic illustration of the trefoil field incident on the bulk material mos2 electrons within solid materials are restricted to specific energy levels known as bands the space between these bands the forbidden energies are known as band gaps both of them together constitute the band structure of the material which is a unique characteristic of each specific material when physicists plot the band structure they usually see that the resulting curves resemble mountains and valleys in fact the technical term for a local energy maximum or minimum in the bands is called a valley and the field that studies and exploits how electrons in the material switch from one valley to the other is coined valleytronics in standard semiconductor electronics the electric charge of the electrons is the most used property exploited to encode and manipulate information but these particles have other properties that could also be used for the same purpose such as the valley they are in in the past decade the main aim of valleytronics has been to reach the control of the valley population also known as valley polarization in materials such an achievement could be used to create classical and quantum gates and bits something that could really drive the development of computing and quantum information processing previous attempts presented several drawbacks for example the light used to manipulate and change valley polarization had to be resonant that is the energy of its photons the particles that constitute light had to correspond exactly to the energy of the band gap of that particular material any small deviation reduced the efficiency of the method so provided that each material has its own band gaps generalizing the proposed mechanism seemed something out of reach moreover this process had only been achieved for monolayer structures 2d materials just one atomthick this requirement hindered its practical implementation as monolayers are usually limited in size quality and difficult to engineer schematic of the valley polarization effect where the incident trefoil field in purple causes valley polarization in the bulk material mos2 this effect can be controlled by rotating the field with respect to the material credit icfo now icfo researchers igor tyulnev julita poborska and dr lenard vamos led by prof icrea jens biegert in collaboration with researchers from the maxborninstitute the maxplanck institute for the science of light and instituto de ciencia de materiales de madrid have found a new universal method to induce valley polarization in centrosymmetric bulk materials the discovery published in nature unlocks the possibility to control and manipulate the valley population without being restricted by the specific chosen material at the same time the method can be used to obtain a more detailed characterization of crystals and 2d materials the adventure began with the experimental group led by icrea prof at icfo jens biegert who initially wanted to experimentally produce valley polarization using their particular method in 2d materials following the lines of what had been theoretically proved in a previous theoretical paper by lvaro jimnez rui silva and misha ivanov to set up the experiment the initial measurement was tried on bulk mos2 a bulk material is made of many monolayers stacked together with the surprising result that they saw the signature of valley polarization when we started working on this project we were told by our theory collaborators that showing valley polarization in bulk materials was rather impossible explains julita poborska the theoretical team remarks as well how at the very beginning their model was only suitable for single 2d layers at first glance it seemed that adding more layers would hinder the selection of specific valleys in the sample but after the first experimental results we adjusted the simulation to bulk materials and it validated the observations surprisingly well we did not even try to fit anything it is just the way it came out adds prof misha ivanov the theorist leader in the end it turned out that yes you can actually valley polarize bulk materials that are central symmetric because of the symmetry conditions concludes poborska researchers at icfo from left to right dr lenard vamos julita poborska igor tyulnev and prof icrea jens biegert credit icfo as igor tyulnev first author of the article explains our experiment consisted in creating an intense light pulse with a polarization that fitted this internal structure the result was the socalled trefoil field whose symmetry matched the triangular sublattices that constitute heteroatomic hexagonal materials this symmetrymatched strong field breaks the space and time symmetry within the material and more importantly the resulting configuration depends on the orientation of the trefoil field with respect to the material therefore by simply rotating the incident light field we were able to modulate the valley polarization concludes tyulnev a major achievement in the field and a confirmation of a novel universal technique that can control and manipulate the electron valleys in bulk materials the experiment can be explained in three main steps first the synthesis of the trefoil field then its characterization and finally the actual production of valley polarization the researchers emphasize the incredibly high precision that the characterization process required as the trefoil field is made of not just one but two coherently combined optical fields one of them had to be circularly polarized in one direction and the other needed to be the second harmonic of the first beam polarized with the opposite handedness they superimposed these fields onto each other so that the total polarization in time traced the desired trefoil shape three years after the initial experimental attempts igor tyulnev is thrilled by the recent nature publication the appearance in such a prestigious journal recognizes the new universal method which as he states can be used not only to control the properties of a wide variety of chemical species but also to characterize crystals and 2d materials as prof icrea at icfo jens biegert remarks our method may provide an important ingredient to engineer energy efficient materials for efficient information storage and fast switching this addresses the pressing need for lowenergy consumption devices and increased computational speed i cannot promise that what we have provided is the solution but it is probably one solution on this

researchers have demonstrated how topological effects in an artificially constructed solid can be manipulated using magnetic fields to switch particle interactions on or off potentially paving the way for advances in quantum technologies their experiments which involved topological pumping in systems of cold fermionic potassium atoms trapped in lasercreated lattices showed that these systems can robustly transport particles in predictable directions even when encountering barriers that reverse their movement generally its advised not to compare apples to oranges however in the field of topology a branch of mathematics this comparison is necessary apples and oranges it turns out are said to be topologically the same since they both lack a hole  in contrast to doughnuts or coffee cups for instance which both have one the handle in the case of the cup and hence are topologically equal in a more abstract way quantum systems in physics can also have a specific apple or doughnut topology which manifests itself in the energy states and motion of particles researchers are very interested in such systems as their topology makes them robust against disorder and other disturbing influences which are always present in natural physical systems things get particularly interesting if in addition the particles in such a system interact meaning that they attract or repel each other like electrons in solids studying topology and interactions together in solids however is extremely difficult a team of researchers at eth led by tilman esslinger has now managed to detect topological effects in an artificial solid in which the interactions can be switched on or off using magnetic fields their results which have just been published in the scientific journal science could be used in quantum technologies in the future zijie zhu a phd student in esslingers lab and first author of the study and his colleagues constructed the artificial solid using extremely cold atoms fermionic potassium atoms which were trapped in spatially periodic lattices using laser beams additional laser beams caused the energy levels of adjacent lattice sites to move up and down periodically out of sync with respect to each other after some time the researchers measured the positions of the atoms in the lattice initially without interactions between the atoms in this experiment they observed that the doughnut topology of the energy states caused the particles to be transported by one lattice site always in the same direction at each repetition of the cycle the results of the eth researchers as an homage to andy warhol the image shows the experimental results of topological pumping credit quantum optics group  eth zurich this can be imagined as the action of a screw says konrad viebahn senior postdoc in esslingers team the screwing motion is a clockwise rotation around its axis but the screw itself moves in the forward direction as a result with each revolution the screw advances a certain distance which is independent of the speed at which one turns the screw such a behavior also known as topological pumping is typical of certain topological systems but what if the screw hits an obstacle in the experiment of the eth researchers that obstacle was an additional laser beam that restricted the freedom of movement of the atoms in the longitudinal direction after around 100 revolutions of the screw the atoms ran into a wall as it were in the analogy used above the wall represents an apple topology in which topological pumping cannot take place surprisingly the atoms didnt simply stop at the wall but suddenly turned around the screw was thus moving backward although it kept being turned clockwise esslinger and his team explain this return by the two doughnut topologies that exist in the lattice  one with a clockwiseturning doughnut and another one that turns in the opposite direction at the wall the atoms can change from one topology to the other thus inverting their direction of motion now the researchers switched on a repulsive interaction between the atoms and watched what happened again they were in for a surprise the atoms now turned around at an invisible barrier even before reaching the laser wall using model calculations we were able to show that the invisible barrier was created by the atoms themselves through their mutual repulsion explains phd student annesophie walter with these observations we have taken a big step towards a better understanding of interacting topological systems says esslinger who studies such effects in the framework of an advanced grant of the swiss national science foundation snf as a next step he wants to perform further experiments to investigate whether the topological screw is as robust as expected with respect to disorder and how the atoms behave in two or three spatial dimensions esslinger also has some practical applications in mind for instance the transport of atoms or ions by topological pumping could be used as a qubit highway to take the qubits quantum bits in quantum computers to the right places without heating them up or disturbing their quantum states reference reversal of

until now the zero magnetic field quantum anomalous hall effect only occurred at very low currents this device can change that credit fijalkowskijmu researchers at the university of wrzburg have developed a method that can improve the performance of quantum resistance standards its based on a quantum phenomenon called the quantum anomalous hall effect the precise measurement of electrical resistance is essential in the industrial production of electronics  for example in the manufacture of hightech sensors microchips and flight controls very precise measurements are essential here as even the smallest deviations can significantly affect these complex systems explains professor charles gould a physicist at the institute for topological insulators at the university of wrzburg jmu with our new measurement method we can significantly improve the accuracy of resistance measurements without any external magnetic field using the quantum anomalous hall effect qahe many people may remember the classic hall effect from their physics lessons when a current flows through a conductor and it is exposed to a magnetic field a voltage is created  the socalled hall voltage the hall resistance obtained by dividing this voltage by current increases as the magnetic field strength increases in thin layers and at large enough magnetic fields this resistance begins to develop discreet steps with values of exactly hne2 where h is the plancks constant e is the elementary charge and n is an integer number this is known as the quantum hall effect because the resistance depends only on fundamental constants of nature h and e which makes it an ideal standard resistor the special feature of the qahe is that it allows the quantum hall effect to exist at zero magnetic field the operation in the absence of any external magnetic field not only simplifies the experiment but also gives an advantage when it comes to determining another physical quantity the kilogram to define a kilogram one has to measure the electrical resistance and the voltage at the same time says gould but measuring the voltage only works without a magnetic field so the qahe is ideal for this thus far the qahe was measured only at currents which are far too low for practical metrological use the reason for this is an electric field that disrupts the qahe at higher currents the wrzburg physicists have now developed a solution to this problem we neutralize the electric field using two separate currents in a geometry we call a multiterminal corbino device explains gould with this new trick the resistance remains quantized to he2 up to larger currents making the resistance standard based on qahe more robust in their feasibility study the researchers were able to show that the new measurement method works at the precision level offered by basic dc techniques their next goal is to test the feasibility of this method using more precise metrological tools to this end the wrzburg group is working closely with the physikalischtechnische bundesanstalt german national metrology institute ptb who specialize in this kind of ultraprecise metrological measurements gould also notes this method is not limited to the qahe given that conventional quantum hall effect experiences similar electric field driven limitations at sufficiently large currents this method can also improve the existing state of the art metrological standards for applications where even larger currents are useful reference a balanced quantum hall resistor by kajetan m fijalkowski nan liu martin klement steffen schreyeck karl brunner charles gould and laurens w molenkamp 15 april 2024 nature electronics doi 101038s41928024011566 the research was funded by the free state of bavaria the german research foundation dfg the cluster of excellence ctqmat complexity and topology in quantum matter and the european commission,Physics
